<p>
I. OLD MOODIE</p>
<p>
The evening before my departure for Blithedale, I was returning to my</p><p>
bachelor apartments, after attending the wonderful exhibition of the</p><p>
Veiled Lady, when an elderly man of rather shabby appearance met me in</p><p>
an obscure part of the street.</p>
<p>
"Mr. Coverdale," said he softly, "can I speak with you a moment?"</p>
<p>
As I have casually alluded to the Veiled Lady, it may not be amiss to</p><p>
mention, for the benefit of such of my readers as are unacquainted with</p><p>
her now forgotten celebrity, that she was a phenomenon in the mesmeric</p><p>
line; one of the earliest that had indicated the birth of a new</p><p>
science, or the revival of an old humbug.  Since those times her</p><p>
sisterhood have grown too numerous to attract much individual notice;</p><p>
nor, in fact, has any one of them come before the public under such</p><p>
skilfully contrived circumstances of stage effect as those which at</p><p>
once mystified and illuminated the remarkable performances of the lady</p><p>
in question.  Nowadays, in the management of his "subject,"</p><p>
"clairvoyant," or "medium," the exhibitor affects the simplicity and</p><p>
openness of scientific experiment; and even if he profess to tread a</p><p>
step or two across the boundaries of the spiritual world, yet carries</p><p>
with him the laws of our actual life and extends them over his</p><p>
preternatural conquests.  Twelve or fifteen years ago, on the contrary,</p><p>
all the arts of mysterious arrangement, of picturesque disposition, and</p><p>
artistically contrasted light and shade, were made available, in order</p><p>
to set the apparent miracle in the strongest attitude of opposition to</p><p>
ordinary facts.  In the case of the Veiled Lady, moreover, the interest</p><p>
of the spectator was further wrought up by the enigma of her identity,</p><p>
and an absurd rumor (probably set afloat by the exhibitor, and at one</p><p>
time very prevalent) that a beautiful young lady, of family and</p><p>
fortune, was enshrouded within the misty drapery of the veil.  It was</p><p>
white, with somewhat of a subdued silver sheen, like the sunny side of</p><p>
a cloud; and, falling over the wearer from head to foot, was supposed</p><p>
to insulate her from the material world, from time and space, and to</p><p>
endow her with many of the privileges of a disembodied spirit.</p>
<p>
Her pretensions, however, whether miraculous or otherwise, have little</p><p>
to do with the present narrative--except, indeed, that I had</p><p>
propounded, for the Veiled Lady's prophetic solution, a query as to the</p><p>
success of our Blithedale enterprise.  The response, by the bye, was of</p><p>
the true Sibylline stamp,--nonsensical in its first aspect, yet on</p><p>
closer study unfolding a variety of interpretations, one of which has</p><p>
certainly accorded with the event.  I was turning over this riddle in</p><p>
my mind, and trying to catch its slippery purport by the tail, when the</p><p>
old man above mentioned interrupted me.</p>
<p>
"Mr. Coverdale!--Mr. Coverdale!" said he, repeating my name twice, in</p><p>
order to make up for the hesitating and ineffectual way in which he</p><p>
uttered it.  "I ask your pardon, sir, but I hear you are going to</p><p>
Blithedale tomorrow."</p>
<p>
I knew the pale, elderly face, with the red-tipt nose, and the patch</p><p>
over one eye; and likewise saw something characteristic in the old</p><p>
fellow's way of standing under the arch of a gate, only revealing</p><p>
enough of himself to make me recognize him as an acquaintance.  He was</p><p>
a very shy personage, this Mr. Moodie; and the trait was the more</p><p>
singular, as his mode of getting his bread necessarily brought him into</p><p>
the stir and hubbub of the world more than the generality of men.</p>
<p>
"Yes, Mr. Moodie," I answered, wondering what interest he could take in</p><p>
the fact, "it is my intention to go to Blithedale to-morrow.  Can I be</p><p>
of any service to you before my departure?"</p>
<p>
"If you pleased, Mr. Coverdale," said he, "you might do me a very great</p><p>
favor."</p>
<p>
"A very great one?" repeated I, in a tone that must have expressed but</p><p>
little alacrity of beneficence, although I was ready to do the old man</p><p>
any amount of kindness involving no special trouble to myself. "A very</p><p>
great favor, do you say?  My time is brief, Mr. Moodie, and I have a</p><p>
good many preparations to make.  But be good enough to tell me what you</p><p>
wish."</p>
<p>
"Ah, sir," replied Old Moodie, "I don't quite like to do that; and, on</p><p>
further thoughts, Mr. Coverdale, perhaps I had better apply to some</p><p>
older gentleman, or to some lady, if you would have the kindness to</p><p>
make me known to one, who may happen to be going to Blithedale. You are</p><p>
a young man, sir!"</p>
<p>
"Does that fact lessen my availability for your purpose?" asked I.</p><p>
"However, if an older man will suit you better, there is Mr.</p><p>
Hollingsworth, who has three or four years the advantage of me in age,</p><p>
and is a much more solid character, and a philanthropist to boot.  I am</p><p>
only a poet, and, so the critics tell me, no great affair at that! But</p><p>
what can this business be, Mr. Moodie?  It begins to interest me;</p><p>
especially since your hint that a lady's influence might be found</p><p>
desirable.  Come, I am really anxious to be of service to you."</p>
<p>
But the old fellow, in his civil and demure manner, was both freakish</p><p>
and obstinate; and he had now taken some notion or other into his head</p><p>
that made him hesitate in his former design.</p>
<p>
"I wonder, sir," said he, "whether you know a lady whom they call</p><p>
Zenobia?"</p>
<p>
"Not personally," I answered, "although I expect that pleasure</p><p>
to-morrow, as she has got the start of the rest of us, and is already a</p><p>
resident at Blithedale.  But have you a literary turn, Mr. Moodie? or</p><p>
have you taken up the advocacy of women's rights? or what else can have</p><p>
interested you in this lady?  Zenobia, by the bye, as I suppose you</p><p>
know, is merely her public name; a sort of mask in which she comes</p><p>
before the world, retaining all the privileges of privacy,--a</p><p>
contrivance, in short, like the white drapery of the Veiled Lady, only</p><p>
a little more transparent.  But it is late.  Will you tell me what I</p><p>
can do for you?"</p>
<p>
"Please to excuse me to-night, Mr. Coverdale," said Moodie.  "You are</p><p>
very kind; but I am afraid I have troubled you, when, after all, there</p><p>
may be no need.  Perhaps, with your good leave, I will come to your</p><p>
lodgings to-morrow morning, before you set out for Blithedale. I wish</p><p>
you a good-night, sir, and beg pardon for stopping you."</p>
<p>
And so he slipt away; and, as he did not show himself the next morning,</p><p>
it was only through subsequent events that I ever arrived at a</p><p>
plausible conjecture as to what his business could have been. Arriving</p><p>
at my room, I threw a lump of cannel coal upon the grate, lighted a</p><p>
cigar, and spent an hour in musings of every hue, from the brightest to</p><p>
the most sombre; being, in truth, not so very confident as at some</p><p>
former periods that this final step, which would mix me up irrevocably</p><p>
with the Blithedale affair, was the wisest that could possibly be</p><p>
taken.  It was nothing short of midnight when I went to bed, after</p><p>
drinking a glass of particularly fine sherry on which I used to pride</p><p>
myself in those days.  It was the very last bottle; and I finished it,</p><p>
with a friend, the next forenoon, before setting out for Blithedale.</p>
<p>
II. BLITHEDALE</p>
<p>
There can hardly remain for me (who am really getting to be a frosty</p><p>
bachelor, with another white hair, every week or so, in my mustache),</p><p>
there can hardly flicker up again so cheery a blaze upon the hearth, as</p><p>
that which I remember, the next day, at Blithedale.  It was a wood</p><p>
fire, in the parlor of an old farmhouse, on an April afternoon, but</p><p>
with the fitful gusts of a wintry snowstorm roaring in the chimney.</p><p>
Vividly does that fireside re-create itself, as I rake away the ashes</p><p>
from the embers in my memory, and blow them up with a sigh, for lack of</p><p>
more inspiring breath.  Vividly for an instant, but anon, with the</p><p>
dimmest gleam, and with just as little fervency for my heart as for my</p><p>
finger-ends!  The staunch oaken logs were long ago burnt out. Their</p><p>
genial glow must be represented, if at all, by the merest phosphoric</p><p>
glimmer, like that which exudes, rather than shines, from damp</p><p>
fragments of decayed trees, deluding the benighted wanderer through a</p><p>
forest.  Around such chill mockery of a fire some few of us might sit</p><p>
on the withered leaves, spreading out each a palm towards the imaginary</p><p>
warmth, and talk over our exploded scheme for beginning the life of</p><p>
Paradise anew.</p>
<p>
Paradise, indeed!  Nobody else in the world, I am bold to</p><p>
affirm--nobody, at least, in our bleak little world of New</p><p>
England,--had dreamed of Paradise that day except as the pole suggests</p><p>
the tropic.  Nor, with such materials as were at hand, could the most</p><p>
skilful architect have constructed any better imitation of Eve's bower</p><p>
than might be seen in the snow hut of an Esquimaux.  But we made a</p><p>
summer of it, in spite of the wild drifts.</p>
<p>
It was an April day, as already hinted, and well towards the middle of</p><p>
the month.  When morning dawned upon me, in town, its temperature was</p><p>
mild enough to be pronounced even balmy, by a lodger, like myself, in</p><p>
one of the midmost houses of a brick block,--each house partaking of</p><p>
the warmth of all the rest, besides the sultriness of its individual</p><p>
furnace--heat.  But towards noon there had come snow, driven along the</p><p>
street by a northeasterly blast, and whitening the roofs and sidewalks</p><p>
with a business-like perseverance that would have done credit to our</p><p>
severest January tempest.  It set about its task apparently as much in</p><p>
earnest as if it had been guaranteed from a thaw for months to come.</p><p>
The greater, surely, was my heroism, when, puffing out a final whiff of</p><p>
cigar-smoke, I quitted my cosey pair of bachelor-rooms,--with a good</p><p>
fire burning in the grate, and a closet right at hand, where there was</p><p>
still a bottle or two in the champagne basket and a residuum of claret</p><p>
in a box,--quitted, I say, these comfortable quarters, and plunged into</p><p>
the heart of the pitiless snowstorm, in quest of a better life.</p>
<p>
The better life!  Possibly, it would hardly look so now; it is enough</p><p>
if it looked so then.  The greatest obstacle to being heroic is the</p><p>
doubt whether one may not be going to prove one's self a fool; the</p><p>
truest heroism is to resist the doubt; and the profoundest wisdom to</p><p>
know when it ought to be resisted, and when to be obeyed.</p>
<p>
Yet, after all, let us acknowledge it wiser, if not more sagacious, to</p><p>
follow out one's daydream to its natural consummation, although, if the</p><p>
vision have been worth the having, it is certain never to be</p><p>
consummated otherwise than by a failure.  And what of that?  Its</p><p>
airiest fragments, impalpable as they may be, will possess a value that</p><p>
lurks not in the most ponderous realities of any practicable scheme.</p><p>
They are not the rubbish of the mind.  Whatever else I may repent of,</p><p>
therefore, let it be reckoned neither among my sins nor follies that I</p><p>
once had faith and force enough to form generous hopes of the world's</p><p>
destiny--yes!--and to do what in me lay for their accomplishment; even</p><p>
to the extent of quitting a warm fireside, flinging away a freshly</p><p>
lighted cigar, and travelling far beyond the strike of city clocks,</p><p>
through a drifting snowstorm.</p>
<p>
There were four of us who rode together through the storm; and</p><p>
Hollingsworth, who had agreed to be of the number, was accidentally</p><p>
delayed, and set forth at a later hour alone.  As we threaded the</p><p>
streets, I remember how the buildings on either side seemed to press</p><p>
too closely upon us, insomuch that our mighty hearts found barely room</p><p>
enough to throb between them.  The snowfall, too, looked inexpressibly</p><p>
dreary (I had almost called it dingy), coming down through an</p><p>
atmosphere of city smoke, and alighting on the sidewalk only to be</p><p>
moulded into the impress of somebody's patched boot or overshoe.  Thus</p><p>
the track of an old conventionalism was visible on what was freshest</p><p>
from the sky.  But when we left the pavements, and our muffled</p><p>
hoof-tramps beat upon a desolate extent of country road, and were</p><p>
effaced by the unfettered blast as soon as stamped, then there was</p><p>
better air to breathe.  Air that had not been breathed once and again!</p><p>
air that had not been spoken into words of falsehood, formality, and</p><p>
error, like all the air of the dusky city!</p>
<p>
"How pleasant it is!" remarked I, while the snowflakes flew into my</p><p>
mouth the moment it was opened.  "How very mild and balmy is this</p><p>
country air!"</p>
<p>
"Ah, Coverdale, don't laugh at what little enthusiasm you have left!"</p><p>
said one of my companions.  "I maintain that this nitrous atmosphere is</p><p>
really exhilarating; and, at any rate, we can never call ourselves</p><p>
regenerated men till a February northeaster shall be as grateful to us</p><p>
as the softest breeze of June!"</p>
<p>
So we all of us took courage, riding fleetly and merrily along, by</p><p>
stone fences that were half buried in the wave-like drifts; and through</p><p>
patches of woodland, where the tree-trunks opposed a snow-incrusted</p><p>
side towards the northeast; and within ken of deserted villas, with no</p><p>
footprints in their avenues; and passed scattered dwellings, whence</p><p>
puffed the smoke of country fires, strongly impregnated with the</p><p>
pungent aroma of burning peat.  Sometimes, encountering a traveller, we</p><p>
shouted a friendly greeting; and he, unmuffling his ears to the bluster</p><p>
and the snow-spray, and listening eagerly, appeared to think our</p><p>
courtesy worth less than the trouble which it cost him.  The churl!  He</p><p>
understood the shrill whistle of the blast, but had no intelligence for</p><p>
our blithe tones of brotherhood.  This lack of faith in our cordial</p><p>
sympathy, on the traveller's part, was one among the innumerable tokens</p><p>
how difficult a task we had in hand for the reformation of the world.</p><p>
We rode on, however, with still unflagging spirits, and made such good</p><p>
companionship with the tempest that, at our journey's end, we professed</p><p>
ourselves almost loath to bid the rude blusterer good-by. But, to own</p><p>
the truth, I was little better than an icicle, and began to be</p><p>
suspicious that I had caught a fearful cold.</p>
<p>
And now we were seated by the brisk fireside of the old farmhouse, the</p><p>
same fire that glimmers so faintly among my reminiscences at the</p><p>
beginning of this chapter.  There we sat, with the snow melting out of</p><p>
our hair and beards, and our faces all ablaze, what with the past</p><p>
inclemency and present warmth.  It was, indeed, a right good fire that</p><p>
we found awaiting us, built up of great, rough logs, and knotty limbs,</p><p>
and splintered fragments of an oak-tree, such as farmers are wont to</p><p>
keep for their own hearths, since these crooked and unmanageable boughs</p><p>
could never be measured into merchantable cords for the market.  A</p><p>
family of the old Pilgrims might have swung their kettle over precisely</p><p>
such a fire as this, only, no doubt, a bigger one; and, contrasting it</p><p>
with my coal-grate, I felt so much the more that we had transported</p><p>
ourselves a world-wide distance from the system of society that</p><p>
shackled us at breakfast-time.</p>
<p>
Good, comfortable Mrs. Foster (the wife of stout Silas Foster, who was</p><p>
to manage the farm at a fair stipend, and be our tutor in the art of</p><p>
husbandry) bade us a hearty welcome.  At her back--a back of generous</p><p>
breadth--appeared two young women, smiling most hospitably, but looking</p><p>
rather awkward withal, as not well knowing what was to be their</p><p>
position in our new arrangement of the world.  We shook hands</p><p>
affectionately all round, and congratulated ourselves that the blessed</p><p>
state of brotherhood and sisterhood, at which we aimed, might fairly be</p><p>
dated from this moment.  Our greetings were hardly concluded when the</p><p>
door opened, and Zenobia--whom I had never before seen, important as</p><p>
was her place in our enterprise--Zenobia entered the parlor.</p>
<p>
This (as the reader, if at all acquainted with our literary biography,</p><p>
need scarcely be told) was not her real name.  She had assumed it, in</p><p>
the first instance, as her magazine signature; and, as it accorded well</p><p>
with something imperial which her friends attributed to this lady's</p><p>
figure and deportment, they half-laughingly adopted it in their</p><p>
familiar intercourse with her.  She took the appellation in good part,</p><p>
and even encouraged its constant use; which, in fact, was thus far</p><p>
appropriate, that our Zenobia, however humble looked her new</p><p>
philosophy, had as much native pride as any queen would have known what</p><p>
to do with.</p>
<p>
III. A KNOT OF DREAMERS</p>
<p>
Zenobia bade us welcome, in a fine, frank, mellow voice, and gave each</p><p>
of us her hand, which was very soft and warm.  She had something</p><p>
appropriate, I recollect, to say to every individual; and what she said</p><p>
to myself was this:--"I have long wished to know you, Mr. Coverdale,</p><p>
and to thank you for your beautiful poetry, some of which I have</p><p>
learned by heart; or rather it has stolen into my memory, without my</p><p>
exercising any choice or volition about the matter.  Of course--permit</p><p>
me to say you do not think of relinquishing an occupation in which you</p><p>
have done yourself so much credit.  I would almost rather give you up</p><p>
as an associate, than that the world should lose one of its true poets!"</p>
<p>
"Ah, no; there will not be the slightest danger of that, especially</p><p>
after this inestimable praise from Zenobia," said I, smiling, and</p><p>
blushing, no doubt, with excess of pleasure.  "I hope, on the contrary,</p><p>
now to produce something that shall really deserve to be called</p><p>
poetry,--true, strong, natural, and sweet, as is the life which we are</p><p>
going to lead,--something that shall have the notes of wild birds</p><p>
twittering through it, or a strain like the wind anthems in the woods,</p><p>
as the case may be."</p>
<p>
"Is it irksome to you to hear your own verses sung?" asked Zenobia,</p><p>
with a gracious smile.  "If so, I am very sorry, for you will certainly</p><p>
hear me singing them sometimes, in the summer evenings."</p>
<p>
"Of all things," answered I, "that is what will delight me most."</p>
<p>
While this passed, and while she spoke to my companions, I was taking</p><p>
note of Zenobia's aspect; and it impressed itself on me so distinctly,</p><p>
that I can now summon her up, like a ghost, a little wanner than the</p><p>
life but otherwise identical with it.  She was dressed as simply as</p><p>
possible, in an American print (I think the dry-goods people call it</p><p>
so), but with a silken kerchief, between which and her gown there was</p><p>
one glimpse of a white shoulder.  It struck me as a great piece of good</p><p>
fortune that there should be just that glimpse.  Her hair, which was</p><p>
dark, glossy, and of singular abundance, was put up rather soberly and</p><p>
primly--without curls, or other ornament, except a single flower.  It</p><p>
was an exotic of rare beauty, and as fresh as if the hothouse gardener</p><p>
had just clipt it from the stem.  That flower has struck deep root into</p><p>
my memory.  I can both see it and smell it, at this moment.  So</p><p>
brilliant, so rare, so costly as it must have been, and yet enduring</p><p>
only for a day, it was more indicative of the pride and pomp which had</p><p>
a luxuriant growth in Zenobia's character than if a great diamond had</p><p>
sparkled among her hair.</p>
<p>
Her hand, though very soft, was larger than most women would like to</p><p>
have, or than they could afford to have, though not a whit too large in</p><p>
proportion with the spacious plan of Zenobia's entire development. It</p><p>
did one good to see a fine intellect (as hers really was, although its</p><p>
natural tendency lay in another direction than towards literature) so</p><p>
fitly cased.  She was, indeed, an admirable figure of a woman, just on</p><p>
the hither verge of her richest maturity, with a combination of</p><p>
features which it is safe to call remarkably beautiful, even if some</p><p>
fastidious persons might pronounce them a little deficient in softness</p><p>
and delicacy.  But we find enough of those attributes everywhere.</p><p>
Preferable--by way of variety, at least--was Zenobia's bloom, health,</p><p>
and vigor, which she possessed in such overflow that a man might well</p><p>
have fallen in love with her for their sake only.  In her quiet moods,</p><p>
she seemed rather indolent; but when really in earnest, particularly if</p><p>
there were a spice of bitter feeling, she grew all alive to her</p><p>
finger-tips.</p>
<p>
"I am the first comer," Zenobia went on to say, while her smile beamed</p><p>
warmth upon us all; "so I take the part of hostess for to-day, and</p><p>
welcome you as if to my own fireside.  You shall be my guests, too, at</p><p>
supper.  Tomorrow, if you please, we will be brethren and sisters, and</p><p>
begin our new life from daybreak."</p>
<p>
"Have we our various parts assigned?" asked some one.</p>
<p>
"Oh, we of the softer sex," responded Zenobia, with her mellow, almost</p><p>
broad laugh,--most delectable to hear, but not in the least like an</p><p>
ordinary woman's laugh,--"we women (there are four of us here already)</p><p>
will take the domestic and indoor part of the business, as a matter of</p><p>
course.  To bake, to boil, to roast, to fry, to stew,--to wash, and</p><p>
iron, and scrub, and sweep,--and, at our idler intervals, to repose</p><p>
ourselves on knitting and sewing,--these, I suppose, must be feminine</p><p>
occupations, for the present.  By and by, perhaps, when our individual</p><p>
adaptations begin to develop themselves, it may be that some of us who</p><p>
wear the petticoat will go afield, and leave the weaker brethren to</p><p>
take our places in the kitchen."</p>
<p>
"What a pity," I remarked, "that the kitchen, and the housework</p><p>
generally, cannot be left out of our system altogether!  It is odd</p><p>
enough that the kind of labor which falls to the lot of women is just</p><p>
that which chiefly distinguishes artificial life--the life of</p><p>
degenerated mortals--from the life of Paradise.  Eve had no dinner-pot,</p><p>
and no clothes to mend, and no washing-day."</p>
<p>
"I am afraid," said Zenobia, with mirth gleaming out of her eyes, "we</p><p>
shall find some difficulty in adopting the paradisiacal system for at</p><p>
least a month to come.  Look at that snowdrift sweeping past the</p><p>
window!  Are there any figs ripe, do you think?  Have the pineapples</p><p>
been gathered to-day?  Would you like a bread-fruit, or a cocoanut?</p><p>
Shall I run out and pluck you some roses?  No, no, Mr. Coverdale; the</p><p>
only flower hereabouts is the one in my hair, which I got out of a</p><p>
greenhouse this morning.  As for the garb of Eden," added she,</p><p>
shivering playfully, "I shall not assume it till after May-day!"</p>
<p>
Assuredly Zenobia could not have intended it,--the fault must have been</p><p>
entirely in my imagination.  But these last words, together with</p><p>
something in her manner, irresistibly brought up a picture of that</p><p>
fine, perfectly developed figure, in Eve's earliest garment.  Her free,</p><p>
careless, generous modes of expression often had this effect of</p><p>
creating images which, though pure, are hardly felt to be quite</p><p>
decorous when born of a thought that passes between man and woman.  I</p><p>
imputed it, at that time, to Zenobia's noble courage, conscious of no</p><p>
harm, and scorning the petty restraints which take the life and color</p><p>
out of other women's conversation.  There was another peculiarity about</p><p>
her.  We seldom meet with women nowadays, and in this country, who</p><p>
impress us as being women at all,--their sex fades away and goes for</p><p>
nothing, in ordinary intercourse.  Not so with Zenobia.  One felt an</p><p>
influence breathing out of her such as we might suppose to come from</p><p>
Eve, when she was just made, and her Creator brought her to Adam,</p><p>
saying, "Behold! here is a woman!"  Not that I would convey the idea of</p><p>
especial gentleness, grace, modesty, and shyness, but of a certain warm</p><p>
and rich characteristic, which seems, for the most part, to have been</p><p>
refined away out of the feminine system.</p>
<p>
"And now," continued Zenobia, "I must go and help get supper.  Do you</p><p>
think you can be content, instead of figs, pineapples, and all the</p><p>
other delicacies of Adam's supper-table, with tea and toast, and a</p><p>
certain modest supply of ham and tongue, which, with the instinct of a</p><p>
housewife, I brought hither in a basket?  And there shall be bread and</p><p>
milk, too, if the innocence of your taste demands it."</p>
<p>
The whole sisterhood now went about their domestic avocations, utterly</p><p>
declining our offers to assist, further than by bringing wood for the</p><p>
kitchen fire from a huge pile in the back yard.  After heaping up more</p><p>
than a sufficient quantity, we returned to the sitting-room, drew our</p><p>
chairs close to the hearth, and began to talk over our prospects.</p><p>
Soon, with a tremendous stamping in the entry, appeared Silas Foster,</p><p>
lank, stalwart, uncouth, and grizzly-bearded. He came from foddering</p><p>
the cattle in the barn, and from the field, where he had been</p><p>
ploughing, until the depth of the snow rendered it impossible to draw a</p><p>
furrow.  He greeted us in pretty much the same tone as if he were</p><p>
speaking to his oxen, took a quid from his iron tobacco-box, pulled off</p><p>
his wet cowhide boots, and sat down before the fire in his</p><p>
stocking-feet.  The steam arose from his soaked garments, so that the</p><p>
stout yeoman looked vaporous and spectre-like.</p>
<p>
"Well, folks," remarked Silas, "you'll be wishing yourselves back to</p><p>
town again, if this weather holds."</p>
<p>
And, true enough, there was a look of gloom, as the twilight fell</p><p>
silently and sadly out of the sky, its gray or sable flakes</p><p>
intermingling themselves with the fast-descending snow.  The storm, in</p><p>
its evening aspect, was decidedly dreary.  It seemed to have arisen for</p><p>
our especial behoof,--a symbol of the cold, desolate, distrustful</p><p>
phantoms that invariably haunt the mind, on the eve of adventurous</p><p>
enterprises, to warn us back within the boundaries of ordinary life.</p>
<p>
But our courage did not quail.  We would not allow ourselves to be</p><p>
depressed by the snowdrift trailing past the window, any more than if</p><p>
it had been the sigh of a summer wind among rustling boughs.  There</p><p>
have been few brighter seasons for us than that.  If ever men might</p><p>
lawfully dream awake, and give utterance to their wildest visions</p><p>
without dread of laughter or scorn on the part of the audience,--yes,</p><p>
and speak of earthly happiness, for themselves and mankind, as an</p><p>
object to be hopefully striven for, and probably attained, we who made</p><p>
that little semicircle round the blazing fire were those very men.  We</p><p>
had left the rusty iron framework of society behind us; we had broken</p><p>
through many hindrances that are powerful enough to keep most people on</p><p>
the weary treadmill of the established system, even while they feel its</p><p>
irksomeness almost as intolerable as we did.  We had stepped down from</p><p>
the pulpit; we had flung aside the pen; we had shut up the ledger; we</p><p>
had thrown off that sweet, bewitching, enervating indolence, which is</p><p>
better, after all, than most of the enjoyments within mortal grasp.  It</p><p>
was our purpose--a generous one, certainly, and absurd, no doubt, in</p><p>
full proportion with its generosity--to give up whatever we had</p><p>
heretofore attained, for the sake of showing mankind the example of a</p><p>
life governed by other than the false and cruel principles on which</p><p>
human society has all along been based.</p>
<p>
And, first of all, we had divorced ourselves from pride, and were</p><p>
striving to supply its place with familiar love.  We meant to lessen</p><p>
the laboring man's great burden of toil, by performing our due share of</p><p>
it at the cost of our own thews and sinews.  We sought our profit by</p><p>
mutual aid, instead of wresting it by the strong hand from an enemy, or</p><p>
filching it craftily from those less shrewd than ourselves (if, indeed,</p><p>
there were any such in New England), or winning it by selfish</p><p>
competition with a neighbor; in one or another of which fashions every</p><p>
son of woman both perpetrates and suffers his share of the common evil,</p><p>
whether he chooses it or no.  And, as the basis of our institution, we</p><p>
purposed to offer up the earnest toil of our bodies, as a prayer no</p><p>
less than an effort for the advancement of our race.</p>
<p>
Therefore, if we built splendid castles (phalansteries perhaps they</p><p>
might be more fitly called), and pictured beautiful scenes, among the</p><p>
fervid coals of the hearth around which we were clustering, and if all</p><p>
went to rack with the crumbling embers and have never since arisen out</p><p>
of the ashes, let us take to ourselves no shame.  In my own behalf, I</p><p>
rejoice that I could once think better of the world's improvability</p><p>
than it deserved.  It is a mistake into which men seldom fall twice in</p><p>
a lifetime; or, if so, the rarer and higher is the nature that can thus</p><p>
magnanimously persist in error.</p>
<p>
Stout Silas Foster mingled little in our conversation; but when he did</p><p>
speak, it was very much to some practical purpose.  For</p><p>
instance:--"Which man among you," quoth he, "is the best judge of</p><p>
swine?  Some of us must go to the next Brighton fair, and buy half a</p><p>
dozen pigs."</p>
<p>
Pigs!  Good heavens! had we come out from among the swinish multitude</p><p>
for this?  And again, in reference to some discussion about raising</p><p>
early vegetables for the market:--"We shall never make any hand at</p><p>
market gardening," said Silas Foster, "unless the women folks will</p><p>
undertake to do all the weeding.  We haven't team enough for that and</p><p>
the regular farm-work, reckoning three of your city folks as worth one</p><p>
common field-hand.  No, no; I tell you, we should have to get up a</p><p>
little too early in the morning, to compete with the market gardeners</p><p>
round Boston."</p>
<p>
It struck me as rather odd, that one of the first questions raised,</p><p>
after our separation from the greedy, struggling, self-seeking world,</p><p>
should relate to the possibility of getting the advantage over the</p><p>
outside barbarians in their own field of labor.  But, to own the truth,</p><p>
I very soon became sensible that, as regarded society at large, we</p><p>
stood in a position of new hostility, rather than new brotherhood. Nor</p><p>
could this fail to be the case, in some degree, until the bigger and</p><p>
better half of society should range itself on our side. Constituting so</p><p>
pitiful a minority as now, we were inevitably estranged from the rest</p><p>
of mankind in pretty fair proportion with the strictness of our mutual</p><p>
bond among ourselves.</p>
<p>
This dawning idea, however, was driven back into my inner consciousness</p><p>
by the entrance of Zenobia.  She came with the welcome intelligence</p><p>
that supper was on the table.  Looking at herself in the glass, and</p><p>
perceiving that her one magnificent flower had grown rather languid</p><p>
(probably by being exposed to the fervency of the kitchen fire), she</p><p>
flung it on the floor, as unconcernedly as a village girl would throw</p><p>
away a faded violet.  The action seemed proper to her character,</p><p>
although, methought, it would still more have befitted the bounteous</p><p>
nature of this beautiful woman to scatter fresh flowers from her hand,</p><p>
and to revive faded ones by her touch. Nevertheless, it was a singular</p><p>
but irresistible effect; the presence of Zenobia caused our heroic</p><p>
enterprise to show like an illusion, a masquerade, a pastoral, a</p><p>
counterfeit Arcadia, in which we grown-up men and women were making a</p><p>
play-day of the years that were given us to live in.  I tried to</p><p>
analyze this impression, but not with much success.</p>
<p>
"It really vexes me," observed Zenobia, as we left the room, "that Mr.</p><p>
Hollingsworth should be such a laggard.  I should not have thought him</p><p>
at all the sort of person to be turned back by a puff of contrary wind,</p><p>
or a few snowflakes drifting into his face."</p>
<p>
"Do you know Hollingsworth personally?"  I inquired.</p>
<p>
"No; only as an auditor--auditress, I mean--of some of his lectures,"</p><p>
said she.  "What a voice he has! and what a man he is!  Yet not so much</p><p>
an intellectual man, I should say, as a great heart; at least, he moved</p><p>
me more deeply than I think myself capable of being moved, except by</p><p>
the stroke of a true, strong heart against my own.  It is a sad pity</p><p>
that he should have devoted his glorious powers to such a grimy,</p><p>
unbeautiful, and positively hopeless object as this reformation of</p><p>
criminals, about which he makes himself and his wretchedly small</p><p>
audiences so very miserable.  To tell you a secret, I never could</p><p>
tolerate a philanthropist before.  Could you?"</p>
<p>
"By no means," I answered; "neither can I now."</p>
<p>
"They are, indeed, an odiously disagreeable set of mortals," continued</p><p>
Zenobia.  "I should like Mr. Hollingsworth a great deal better if the</p><p>
philanthropy had been left out.  At all events, as a mere matter of</p><p>
taste, I wish he would let the bad people alone, and try to benefit</p><p>
those who are not already past his help.  Do you suppose he will be</p><p>
content to spend his life, or even a few months of it, among tolerably</p><p>
virtuous and comfortable individuals like ourselves?"</p>
<p>
"Upon my word, I doubt it," said I. "If we wish to keep him with us, we</p><p>
must systematically commit at least one crime apiece!  Mere peccadillos</p><p>
will not satisfy him."</p>
<p>
Zenobia turned, sidelong, a strange kind of a glance upon me; but,</p><p>
before I could make out what it meant, we had entered the kitchen,</p><p>
where, in accordance with the rustic simplicity of our new life, the</p><p>
supper-table was spread.</p>
<p>
IV. THE SUPPER-TABLE</p>
<p>
The pleasant firelight!  I must still keep harping on it.  The kitchen</p><p>
hearth had an old-fashioned breadth, depth, and spaciousness, far</p><p>
within which lay what seemed the butt of a good-sized oak-tree, with</p><p>
the moisture bubbling merrily out at both ends.  It was now half an</p><p>
hour beyond dusk.  The blaze from an armful of substantial sticks,</p><p>
rendered more combustible by brushwood and pine, flickered powerfully</p><p>
on the smoke-blackened walls, and so cheered our spirits that we cared</p><p>
not what inclemency might rage and roar on the other side of our</p><p>
illuminated windows.  A yet sultrier warmth was bestowed by a goodly</p><p>
quantity of peat, which was crumbling to white ashes among the burning</p><p>
brands, and incensed the kitchen with its not ungrateful fragrance.</p><p>
The exuberance of this household fire would alone have sufficed to</p><p>
bespeak us no true farmers; for the New England yeoman, if he have the</p><p>
misfortune to dwell within practicable distance of a wood-market, is as</p><p>
niggardly of each stick as if it were a bar of California gold.</p>
<p>
But it was fortunate for us, on that wintry eve of our untried life, to</p><p>
enjoy the warm and radiant luxury of a somewhat too abundant fire. If</p><p>
it served no other purpose, it made the men look so full of youth, warm</p><p>
blood, and hope, and the women--such of them, at least, as were anywise</p><p>
convertible by its magic--so very beautiful, that I would cheerfully</p><p>
have spent my last dollar to prolong the blaze.  As for Zenobia, there</p><p>
was a glow in her cheeks that made me think of Pandora, fresh from</p><p>
Vulcan's workshop, and full of the celestial warmth by dint of which he</p><p>
had tempered and moulded her.</p>
<p>
"Take your places, my dear friends all," cried she; "seat yourselves</p><p>
without ceremony, and you shall be made happy with such tea as not many</p><p>
of the world's working-people, except yourselves, will find in their</p><p>
cups to-night.  After this one supper, you may drink buttermilk, if you</p><p>
please.  To-night we will quaff this nectar, which, I assure you, could</p><p>
not be bought with gold."</p>
<p>
We all sat down,--grizzly Silas Foster, his rotund helpmate, and the</p><p>
two bouncing handmaidens, included,--and looked at one another in a</p><p>
friendly but rather awkward way.  It was the first practical trial of</p><p>
our theories of equal brotherhood and sisterhood; and we people of</p><p>
superior cultivation and refinement (for as such, I presume, we</p><p>
unhesitatingly reckoned ourselves) felt as if something were already</p><p>
accomplished towards the millennium of love.  The truth is, however,</p><p>
that the laboring oar was with our unpolished companions; it being far</p><p>
easier to condescend than to accept of condescension.  Neither did I</p><p>
refrain from questioning, in secret, whether some of us--and Zenobia</p><p>
among the rest--would so quietly have taken our places among these good</p><p>
people, save for the cherished consciousness that it was not by</p><p>
necessity but choice.  Though we saw fit to drink our tea out of</p><p>
earthen cups to-night, and in earthen company, it was at our own option</p><p>
to use pictured porcelain and handle silver forks again to-morrow.</p><p>
This same salvo, as to the power of regaining our former position,</p><p>
contributed much, I fear, to the equanimity with which we subsequently</p><p>
bore many of the hardships and humiliations of a life of toil.  If ever</p><p>
I have deserved (which has not often been the case, and, I think,</p><p>
never), but if ever I did deserve to be soundly cuffed by a fellow</p><p>
mortal, for secretly putting weight upon some imaginary social</p><p>
advantage, it must have been while I was striving to prove myself</p><p>
ostentatiously his equal and no more.  It was while I sat beside him on</p><p>
his cobbler's bench, or clinked my hoe against his own in the</p><p>
cornfield, or broke the same crust of bread, my earth-grimed hand to</p><p>
his, at our noontide lunch.  The poor, proud man should look at both</p><p>
sides of sympathy like this.</p>
<p>
The silence which followed upon our sitting down to table grew rather</p><p>
oppressive; indeed, it was hardly broken by a word, during the first</p><p>
round of Zenobia's fragrant tea.</p>
<p>
"I hope," said I, at last, "that our blazing windows will be visible a</p><p>
great way off.  There is nothing so pleasant and encouraging to a</p><p>
solitary traveller, on a stormy night, as a flood of firelight seen</p><p>
amid the gloom.  These ruddy window panes cannot fail to cheer the</p><p>
hearts of all that look at them.  Are they not warm with the</p><p>
beacon-fire which we have kindled for humanity?"</p>
<p>
"The blaze of that brushwood will only last a minute or two longer,"</p><p>
observed Silas Foster; but whether he meant to insinuate that our moral</p><p>
illumination would have as brief a term, I cannot say.</p>
<p>
"Meantime," said Zenobia, "it may serve to guide some wayfarer to a</p><p>
shelter."</p>
<p>
And, just as she said this, there came a knock at the house door.</p>
<p>
"There is one of the world's wayfarers," said I. "Ay, ay, just so!"</p><p>
quoth Silas Foster.  "Our firelight will draw stragglers, just as a</p><p>
candle draws dorbugs on a summer night."</p>
<p>
Whether to enjoy a dramatic suspense, or that we were selfishly</p><p>
contrasting our own comfort with the chill and dreary situation of the</p><p>
unknown person at the threshold, or that some of us city folk felt a</p><p>
little startled at the knock which came so unseasonably, through night</p><p>
and storm, to the door of the lonely farmhouse,--so it happened that</p><p>
nobody, for an instant or two, arose to answer the summons.  Pretty</p><p>
soon there came another knock.  The first had been moderately loud; the</p><p>
second was smitten so forcibly that the knuckles of the applicant must</p><p>
have left their mark in the door panel.</p>
<p>
"He knocks as if he had a right to come in," said Zenobia, laughing.</p><p>
"And what are we thinking of?--It must be Mr. Hollingsworth!"</p>
<p>
Hereupon I went to the door, unbolted, and flung it wide open.  There,</p><p>
sure enough, stood Hollingsworth, his shaggy greatcoat all covered with</p><p>
snow, so that he looked quite as much like a polar bear as a modern</p><p>
philanthropist.</p>
<p>
"Sluggish hospitality this!" said he, in those deep tones of his, which</p><p>
seemed to come out of a chest as capacious as a barrel.  "It would have</p><p>
served you right if I had lain down and spent the night on the</p><p>
doorstep, just for the sake of putting you to shame.  But here is a</p><p>
guest who will need a warmer and softer bed."</p>
<p>
And, stepping back to the wagon in which he had journeyed hither,</p><p>
Hollingsworth received into his arms and deposited on the doorstep a</p><p>
figure enveloped in a cloak.  It was evidently a woman; or,</p><p>
rather,--judging from the ease with which he lifted her, and the little</p><p>
space which she seemed to fill in his arms, a slim and unsubstantial</p><p>
girl.  As she showed some hesitation about entering the door,</p><p>
Hollingsworth, with his usual directness and lack of ceremony, urged</p><p>
her forward not merely within the entry, but into the warm and strongly</p><p>
lighted kitchen.</p>
<p>
"Who is this?" whispered I, remaining behind with him, while he was</p><p>
taking off his greatcoat.</p>
<p>
"Who?  Really, I don't know," answered Hollingsworth, looking at me</p><p>
with some surprise.  "It is a young person who belongs here, however;</p><p>
and no doubt she had been expected.  Zenobia, or some of the women</p><p>
folks, can tell you all about it."</p>
<p>
"I think not," said I, glancing towards the new-comer and the other</p><p>
occupants of the kitchen.  "Nobody seems to welcome her.  I should</p><p>
hardly judge that she was an expected guest."</p>
<p>
"Well, well," said Hollingsworth quietly, "We'll make it right."</p>
<p>
The stranger, or whatever she were, remained standing precisely on that</p><p>
spot of the kitchen floor to which Hollingsworth's kindly hand had</p><p>
impelled her.  The cloak falling partly off, she was seen to be a very</p><p>
young woman dressed in a poor but decent gown, made high in the neck,</p><p>
and without any regard to fashion or smartness.  Her brown hair fell</p><p>
down from beneath a hood, not in curls but with only a slight wave; her</p><p>
face was of a wan, almost sickly hue, betokening habitual seclusion</p><p>
from the sun and free atmosphere, like a flower-shrub that had done its</p><p>
best to blossom in too scanty light.  To complete the pitiableness of</p><p>
her aspect, she shivered either with cold, or fear, or nervous</p><p>
excitement, so that you might have beheld her shadow vibrating on the</p><p>
fire-lighted wall.  In short, there has seldom been seen so depressed</p><p>
and sad a figure as this young girl's; and it was hardly possible to</p><p>
help being angry with her, from mere despair of doing anything for her</p><p>
comfort.  The fantasy occurred to me that she was some desolate kind of</p><p>
a creature, doomed to wander about in snowstorms; and that, though the</p><p>
ruddiness of our window panes had tempted her into a human dwelling,</p><p>
she would not remain long enough to melt the icicles out of her hair.</p><p>
Another conjecture likewise came into my mind.  Recollecting</p><p>
Hollingsworth's sphere of philanthropic action, I deemed it possible</p><p>
that he might have brought one of his guilty patients, to be wrought</p><p>
upon and restored to spiritual health by the pure influences which our</p><p>
mode of life would create.</p>
<p>
As yet the girl had not stirred.  She stood near the door, fixing a</p><p>
pair of large, brown, melancholy eyes upon Zenobia--only upon</p><p>
Zenobia!--she evidently saw nothing else in the room save that bright,</p><p>
fair, rosy, beautiful woman.  It was the strangest look I ever</p><p>
witnessed; long a mystery to me, and forever a memory.  Once she seemed</p><p>
about to move forward and greet her,--I know not with what warmth or</p><p>
with what words,--but, finally, instead of doing so, she dropped down</p><p>
upon her knees, clasped her hands, and gazed piteously into Zenobia's</p><p>
face. Meeting no kindly reception, her head fell on her bosom.</p>
<p>
I never thoroughly forgave Zenobia for her conduct on this occasion.</p><p>
But women are always more cautious in their casual hospitalities than</p><p>
men.</p>
<p>
"What does the girl mean?" cried she in rather a sharp tone.  "Is she</p><p>
crazy?  Has she no tongue?"</p>
<p>
And here Hollingsworth stepped forward.</p>
<p>
"No wonder if the poor child's tongue is frozen in her mouth," said he;</p><p>
and I think he positively frowned at Zenobia.  "The very heart will be</p><p>
frozen in her bosom, unless you women can warm it, among you, with the</p><p>
warmth that ought to be in your own!"</p>
<p>
Hollingsworth's appearance was very striking at this moment.  He was</p><p>
then about thirty years old, but looked several years older, with his</p><p>
great shaggy head, his heavy brow, his dark complexion, his abundant</p><p>
beard, and the rude strength with which his features seemed to have</p><p>
been hammered out of iron, rather than chiselled or moulded from any</p><p>
finer or softer material.  His figure was not tall, but massive and</p><p>
brawny, and well befitting his original occupation; which as the reader</p><p>
probably knows--was that of a blacksmith.  As for external polish, or</p><p>
mere courtesy of manner, he never possessed more than a tolerably</p><p>
educated bear; although, in his gentler moods, there was a tenderness</p><p>
in his voice, eyes, mouth, in his gesture, and in every indescribable</p><p>
manifestation, which few men could resist and no woman. But he now</p><p>
looked stern and reproachful; and it was with that inauspicious meaning</p><p>
in his glance that Hollingsworth first met Zenobia's eyes, and began</p><p>
his influence upon her life.</p>
<p>
To my surprise, Zenobia--of whose haughty spirit I had been told so</p><p>
many examples--absolutely changed color, and seemed mortified and</p><p>
confused.</p>
<p>
"You do not quite do me justice, Mr. Hollingsworth," said she almost</p><p>
humbly.  "I am willing to be kind to the poor girl.  Is she a protegee</p><p>
of yours?  What can I do for her?"</p>
<p>
"Have you anything to ask of this lady?" said Hollingsworth kindly to</p><p>
the girl.  "I remember you mentioned her name before we left town."</p>
<p>
"Only that she will shelter me," replied the girl tremulously.  "Only</p><p>
that she will let me be always near her."</p>
<p>
"Well, indeed," exclaimed Zenobia, recovering herself and laughing,</p><p>
"this is an adventure, and well-worthy to be the first incident in our</p><p>
life of love and free-heartedness!  But I accept it, for the present,</p><p>
without further question, only," added she, "it would be a convenience</p><p>
if we knew your name."</p>
<p>
"Priscilla," said the girl; and it appeared to me that she hesitated</p><p>
whether to add anything more, and decided in the negative.  "Pray do</p><p>
not ask me my other name,--at least not yet,--if you will be so kind to</p><p>
a forlorn creature."</p>
<p>
Priscilla!--Priscilla!  I repeated the name to myself three or four</p><p>
times; and in that little space, this quaint and prim cognomen had so</p><p>
amalgamated itself with my idea of the girl, that it seemed as if no</p><p>
other name could have adhered to her for a moment.  Heretofore the poor</p><p>
thing had not shed any tears; but now that she found herself received,</p><p>
and at least temporarily established, the big drops began to ooze out</p><p>
from beneath her eyelids as if she were full of them. Perhaps it showed</p><p>
the iron substance of my heart, that I could not help smiling at this</p><p>
odd scene of unknown and unaccountable calamity, into which our</p><p>
cheerful party had been entrapped without the liberty of choosing</p><p>
whether to sympathize or no.  Hollingsworth's behavior was certainly a</p><p>
great deal more creditable than mine.</p>
<p>
"Let us not pry further into her secrets," he said to Zenobia and the</p><p>
rest of us, apart; and his dark, shaggy face looked really beautiful</p><p>
with its expression of thoughtful benevolence.  "Let us conclude that</p><p>
Providence has sent her to us, as the first-fruits of the world, which</p><p>
we have undertaken to make happier than we find it.  Let us warm her</p><p>
poor, shivering body with this good fire, and her poor, shivering heart</p><p>
with our best kindness.  Let us feed her, and make her one of us.  As</p><p>
we do by this friendless girl, so shall we prosper. And, in good time,</p><p>
whatever is desirable for us to know will be melted out of her, as</p><p>
inevitably as those tears which we see now."</p>
<p>
"At least," remarked I, "you may tell us how and where you met with</p><p>
her."</p>
<p>
"An old man brought her to my lodgings," answered Hollingsworth, "and</p><p>
begged me to convey her to Blithedale, where--so I understood him--she</p><p>
had friends; and this is positively all I know about the matter."</p>
<p>
Grim Silas Foster, all this while, had been busy at the supper-table,</p><p>
pouring out his own tea and gulping it down with no more sense of its</p><p>
exquisiteness than if it were a decoction of catnip; helping himself to</p><p>
pieces of dipt toast on the flat of his knife blade, and dropping half</p><p>
of it on the table-cloth; using the same serviceable implement to cut</p><p>
slice after slice of ham; perpetrating terrible enormities with the</p><p>
butter-plate; and in all other respects behaving less like a civilized</p><p>
Christian than the worst kind of an ogre.  Being by this time fully</p><p>
gorged, he crowned his amiable exploits with a draught from the water</p><p>
pitcher, and then favored us with his opinion about the business in</p><p>
hand.  And, certainly, though they proceeded out of an unwiped mouth,</p><p>
his expressions did him honor.</p>
<p>
"Give the girl a hot cup of tea and a thick slice of this first-rate</p><p>
bacon," said Silas, like a sensible man as he was.  "That's what she</p><p>
wants.  Let her stay with us as long as she likes, and help in the</p><p>
kitchen, and take the cow-breath at milking time; and, in a week or</p><p>
two, she'll begin to look like a creature of this world."</p>
<p>
So we sat down again to supper, and Priscilla along with us.</p>
<p>
V. UNTIL BEDTIME</p>
<p>
Silas Foster, by the time we concluded our meal, had stript off his</p><p>
coat, and planted himself on a low chair by the kitchen fire, with a</p><p>
lapstone, a hammer, a piece of sole leather, and some waxed-ends, in</p><p>
order to cobble an old pair of cowhide boots; he being, in his own</p><p>
phrase, "something of a dab" (whatever degree of skill that may imply)</p><p>
at the shoemaking business.  We heard the tap of his hammer at</p><p>
intervals for the rest of the evening.  The remainder of the party</p><p>
adjourned to the sitting-room.  Good Mrs. Foster took her</p><p>
knitting-work, and soon fell fast asleep, still keeping her needles in</p><p>
brisk movement, and, to the best of my observation, absolutely footing</p><p>
a stocking out of the texture of a dream.  And a very substantial</p><p>
stocking it seemed to be.  One of the two handmaidens hemmed a towel,</p><p>
and the other appeared to be making a ruffle, for her Sunday's wear,</p><p>
out of a little bit of embroidered muslin which Zenobia had probably</p><p>
given her.</p>
<p>
It was curious to observe how trustingly, and yet how timidly, our poor</p><p>
Priscilla betook herself into the shadow of Zenobia's protection. She</p><p>
sat beside her on a stool, looking up every now and then with an</p><p>
expression of humble delight at her new friend's beauty.  A brilliant</p><p>
woman is often an object of the devoted admiration--it might almost be</p><p>
termed worship, or idolatry--of some young girl, who perhaps beholds</p><p>
the cynosure only at an awful distance, and has as little hope of</p><p>
personal intercourse as of climbing among the stars of heaven.  We men</p><p>
are too gross to comprehend it.  Even a woman, of mature age, despises</p><p>
or laughs at such a passion.  There occurred to me no mode of</p><p>
accounting for Priscilla's behavior, except by supposing that she had</p><p>
read some of Zenobia's stories (as such literature goes everywhere), or</p><p>
her tracts in defence of the sex, and had come hither with the one</p><p>
purpose of being her slave.  There is nothing parallel to this, I</p><p>
believe,--nothing so foolishly disinterested, and hardly anything so</p><p>
beautiful,--in the masculine nature, at whatever epoch of life; or, if</p><p>
there be, a fine and rare development of character might reasonably be</p><p>
looked for from the youth who should prove himself capable of such</p><p>
self-forgetful affection.</p>
<p>
Zenobia happening to change her seat, I took the opportunity, in an</p><p>
undertone, to suggest some such notion as the above.</p>
<p>
"Since you see the young woman in so poetical a light," replied she in</p><p>
the same tone, "you had better turn the affair into a ballad.  It is a</p><p>
grand subject, and worthy of supernatural machinery.  The storm, the</p><p>
startling knock at the door, the entrance of the sable knight</p><p>
Hollingsworth and this shadowy snow-maiden, who, precisely at the</p><p>
stroke of midnight, shall melt away at my feet in a pool of ice-cold</p><p>
water and give me my death with a pair of wet slippers!  And when the</p><p>
verses are written, and polished quite to your mind, I will favor you</p><p>
with my idea as to what the girl really is."</p>
<p>
"Pray let me have it now," said I; "it shall be woven into the ballad."</p>
<p>
"She is neither more nor less," answered Zenobia, "than a seamstress</p><p>
from the city; and she has probably no more transcendental purpose than</p><p>
to do my miscellaneous sewing, for I suppose she will hardly expect to</p><p>
make my dresses."</p>
<p>
"How can you decide upon her so easily?"  I inquired.</p>
<p>
"Oh, we women judge one another by tokens that escape the obtuseness of</p><p>
masculine perceptions!" said Zenobia.  "There is no proof which you</p><p>
would be likely to appreciate, except the needle marks on the tip of</p><p>
her forefinger.  Then, my supposition perfectly accounts for her</p><p>
paleness, her nervousness, and her wretched fragility.  Poor thing! She</p><p>
has been stifled with the heat of a salamander stove, in a small, close</p><p>
room, and has drunk coffee, and fed upon doughnuts, raisins, candy, and</p><p>
all such trash, till she is scarcely half alive; and so, as she has</p><p>
hardly any physique, a poet like Mr. Miles Coverdale may be allowed to</p><p>
think her spiritual."</p>
<p>
"Look at her now!" whispered I.</p>
<p>
Priscilla was gazing towards us with an inexpressible sorrow in her wan</p><p>
face and great tears running down her cheeks.  It was difficult to</p><p>
resist the impression that, cautiously as we had lowered our voices,</p><p>
she must have overheard and been wounded by Zenobia's scornful estimate</p><p>
of her character and purposes.</p>
<p>
"What ears the girl must have!" whispered Zenobia, with a look of</p><p>
vexation, partly comic and partly real.  "I will confess to you that I</p><p>
cannot quite make her out.  However, I am positively not an ill-natured</p><p>
person, unless when very grievously provoked,--and as you, and</p><p>
especially Mr. Hollingsworth, take so much interest in this odd</p><p>
creature, and as she knocks with a very slight tap against my own heart</p><p>
likewise,--why, I mean to let her in.  From this moment I will be</p><p>
reasonably kind to her.  There is no pleasure in tormenting a person of</p><p>
one's own sex, even if she do favor one with a little more love than</p><p>
one can conveniently dispose of; and that, let me say, Mr. Coverdale,</p><p>
is the most troublesome offence you can offer to a woman."</p>
<p>
"Thank you," said I, smiling; "I don't mean to be guilty of it."</p>
<p>
She went towards Priscilla, took her hand, and passed her own rosy</p><p>
finger-tips, with a pretty, caressing movement, over the girl's hair.</p><p>
The touch had a magical effect.  So vivid a look of joy flushed up</p><p>
beneath those fingers, that it seemed as if the sad and wan Priscilla</p><p>
had been snatched away, and another kind of creature substituted in her</p><p>
place.  This one caress, bestowed voluntarily by Zenobia, was evidently</p><p>
received as a pledge of all that the stranger sought from her, whatever</p><p>
the unuttered boon might be.  From that instant, too, she melted in</p><p>
quietly amongst us, and was no longer a foreign element. Though always</p><p>
an object of peculiar interest, a riddle, and a theme of frequent</p><p>
discussion, her tenure at Blithedale was thenceforth fixed.  We no more</p><p>
thought of questioning it, than if Priscilla had been recognized as a</p><p>
domestic sprite, who had haunted the rustic fireside of old, before we</p><p>
had ever been warmed by its blaze.</p>
<p>
She now produced, out of a work-bag that she had with her, some little</p><p>
wooden instruments (what they are called I never knew), and proceeded</p><p>
to knit, or net, an article which ultimately took the shape of a silk</p><p>
purse.  As the work went on, I remembered to have seen just such purses</p><p>
before; indeed, I was the possessor of one.  Their peculiar excellence,</p><p>
besides the great delicacy and beauty of the manufacture, lay in the</p><p>
almost impossibility that any uninitiated person should discover the</p><p>
aperture; although, to a practised touch, they would open as wide as</p><p>
charity or prodigality might wish.  I wondered if it were not a symbol</p><p>
of Priscilla's own mystery.</p>
<p>
Notwithstanding the new confidence with which Zenobia had inspired her,</p><p>
our guest showed herself disquieted by the storm.  When the strong</p><p>
puffs of wind spattered the snow against the windows and made the oaken</p><p>
frame of the farmhouse creak, she looked at us apprehensively, as if to</p><p>
inquire whether these tempestuous outbreaks did not betoken some</p><p>
unusual mischief in the shrieking blast.  She had been bred up, no</p><p>
doubt, in some close nook, some inauspiciously sheltered court of the</p><p>
city, where the uttermost rage of a tempest, though it might scatter</p><p>
down the slates of the roof into the bricked area, could not shake the</p><p>
casement of her little room.  The sense of vast, undefined space,</p><p>
pressing from the outside against the black panes of our uncurtained</p><p>
windows, was fearful to the poor girl, heretofore accustomed to the</p><p>
narrowness of human limits, with the lamps of neighboring tenements</p><p>
glimmering across the street.  The house probably seemed to her adrift</p><p>
on the great ocean of the night. A little parallelogram of sky was all</p><p>
that she had hitherto known of nature, so that she felt the awfulness</p><p>
that really exists in its limitless extent.  Once, while the blast was</p><p>
bellowing, she caught hold of Zenobia's robe, with precisely the air of</p><p>
one who hears her own name spoken at a distance, but is unutterably</p><p>
reluctant to obey the call.</p>
<p>
We spent rather an incommunicative evening.  Hollingsworth hardly said</p><p>
a word, unless when repeatedly and pertinaciously addressed. Then,</p><p>
indeed, he would glare upon us from the thick shrubbery of his</p><p>
meditations like a tiger out of a jungle, make the briefest reply</p><p>
possible, and betake himself back into the solitude of his heart and</p><p>
mind.  The poor fellow had contracted this ungracious habit from the</p><p>
intensity with which he contemplated his own ideas, and the infrequent</p><p>
sympathy which they met with from his auditors,--a circumstance that</p><p>
seemed only to strengthen the implicit confidence that he awarded to</p><p>
them.  His heart, I imagine, was never really interested in our</p><p>
socialist scheme, but was forever busy with his strange, and, as most</p><p>
people thought it, impracticable plan, for the reformation of criminals</p><p>
through an appeal to their higher instincts.</p>
<p>
Much as I liked Hollingsworth, it cost me many a groan to tolerate him</p><p>
on this point.  He ought to have commenced his investigation of the</p><p>
subject by perpetrating some huge sin in his proper person, and</p><p>
examining the condition of his higher instincts afterwards.</p>
<p>
The rest of us formed ourselves into a committee for providing our</p><p>
infant community with an appropriate name,--a matter of greatly more</p><p>
difficulty than the uninitiated reader would suppose.  Blithedale was</p><p>
neither good nor bad.  We should have resumed the old Indian name of</p><p>
the premises, had it possessed the oil-and-honey flow which the</p><p>
aborigines were so often happy in communicating to their local</p><p>
appellations; but it chanced to be a harsh, ill-connected, and</p><p>
interminable word, which seemed to fill the mouth with a mixture of</p><p>
very stiff clay and very crumbly pebbles.  Zenobia suggested "Sunny</p><p>
Glimpse," as expressive of a vista into a better system of society.</p><p>
This we turned over and over for a while, acknowledging its prettiness,</p><p>
but concluded it to be rather too fine and sentimental a name (a fault</p><p>
inevitable by literary ladies in such attempts) for sunburnt men to</p><p>
work under.  I ventured to whisper "Utopia," which, however, was</p><p>
unanimously scouted down, and the proposer very harshly maltreated, as</p><p>
if he had intended a latent satire.  Some were for calling our</p><p>
institution "The Oasis," in view of its being the one green spot in the</p><p>
moral sand-waste of the world; but others insisted on a proviso for</p><p>
reconsidering the matter at a twelvemonths' end, when a final decision</p><p>
might be had, whether to name it "The Oasis" or "Sahara."  So, at last,</p><p>
finding it impracticable to hammer out anything better, we resolved</p><p>
that the spot should still be Blithedale, as being of good augury</p><p>
enough.</p>
<p>
The evening wore on, and the outer solitude looked in upon us through</p><p>
the windows, gloomy, wild, and vague, like another state of existence,</p><p>
close beside the little sphere of warmth and light in which we were the</p><p>
prattlers and bustlers of a moment.  By and by the door was opened by</p><p>
Silas Foster, with a cotton handkerchief about his head, and a tallow</p><p>
candle in his hand.</p>
<p>
"Take my advice, brother farmers," said he, with a great, broad,</p><p>
bottomless yawn, "and get to bed as soon as you can.  I shall sound the</p><p>
horn at daybreak; and we've got the cattle to fodder, and nine cows to</p><p>
milk, and a dozen other things to do, before breakfast."</p>
<p>
Thus ended the first evening at Blithedale.  I went shivering to my</p><p>
fireless chamber, with the miserable consciousness (which had been</p><p>
growing upon me for several hours past) that I had caught a tremendous</p><p>
cold, and should probably awaken, at the blast of the horn, a fit</p><p>
subject for a hospital.  The night proved a feverish one. During the</p><p>
greater part of it, I was in that vilest of states when a fixed idea</p><p>
remains in the mind, like the nail in Sisera's brain, while innumerable</p><p>
other ideas go and come, and flutter to and fro, combining constant</p><p>
transition with intolerable sameness.  Had I made a record of that</p><p>
night's half-waking dreams, it is my belief that it would have</p><p>
anticipated several of the chief incidents of this narrative, including</p><p>
a dim shadow of its catastrophe.  Starting up in bed at length, I saw</p><p>
that the storm was past, and the moon was shining on the snowy</p><p>
landscape, which looked like a lifeless copy of the world in marble.</p>
<p>
From the bank of the distant river, which was shimmering in the</p><p>
moonlight, came the black shadow of the only cloud in heaven, driven</p><p>
swiftly by the wind, and passing over meadow and hillock, vanishing</p><p>
amid tufts of leafless trees, but reappearing on the hither side, until</p><p>
it swept across our doorstep.</p>
<p>
How cold an Arcadia was this!</p>
<p>
VI. COVERDALE'S SICK-CHAMBER</p>
<p>
The horn sounded at daybreak, as Silas Foster had forewarned us, harsh,</p><p>
uproarious, inexorably drawn out, and as sleep-dispelling as if this</p><p>
hard-hearted old yeoman had got hold of the trump of doom.</p>
<p>
On all sides I could hear the creaking of the bedsteads, as the</p><p>
brethren of Blithedale started from slumber, and thrust themselves into</p><p>
their habiliments, all awry, no doubt, in their haste to begin the</p><p>
reformation of the world.  Zenobia put her head into the entry, and</p><p>
besought Silas Foster to cease his clamor, and to be kind enough to</p><p>
leave an armful of firewood and a pail of water at her chamber door.</p><p>
Of the whole household,--unless, indeed, it were Priscilla, for whose</p><p>
habits, in this particular, I cannot vouch,--of all our apostolic</p><p>
society, whose mission was to bless mankind, Hollingsworth, I</p><p>
apprehend, was the only one who began the enterprise with prayer. My</p><p>
sleeping-room being but thinly partitioned from his, the solemn murmur</p><p>
of his voice made its way to my ears, compelling me to be an auditor of</p><p>
his awful privacy with the Creator.  It affected me with a deep</p><p>
reverence for Hollingsworth, which no familiarity then existing, or</p><p>
that afterwards grew more intimate between us,--no, nor my subsequent</p><p>
perception of his own great errors,--ever quite effaced. It is so rare,</p><p>
in these times, to meet with a man of prayerful habits (except, of</p><p>
course, in the pulpit), that such an one is decidedly marked out by the</p><p>
light of transfiguration, shed upon him in the divine interview from</p><p>
which he passes into his daily life.</p>
<p>
As for me, I lay abed; and if I said my prayers, it was backward,</p><p>
cursing my day as bitterly as patient Job himself.  The truth was, the</p><p>
hot-house warmth of a town residence, and the luxurious life in which I</p><p>
indulged myself, had taken much of the pith out of my physical system;</p><p>
and the wintry blast of the preceding day, together with the general</p><p>
chill of our airy old farmhouse, had got fairly into my heart and the</p><p>
marrow of my bones.  In this predicament, I seriously wished--selfish</p><p>
as it may appear--that the reformation of society had been postponed</p><p>
about half a century, or, at all events, to such a date as should have</p><p>
put my intermeddling with it entirely out of the question.</p>
<p>
What, in the name of common-sense, had I to do with any better society</p><p>
than I had always lived in?  It had satisfied me well enough. My</p><p>
pleasant bachelor-parlor, sunny and shadowy, curtained and carpeted,</p><p>
with the bedchamber adjoining; my centre-table, strewn with books and</p><p>
periodicals; my writing-desk with a half-finished poem, in a stanza of</p><p>
my own contrivance; my morning lounge at the reading-room or picture</p><p>
gallery; my noontide walk along the cheery pavement, with the</p><p>
suggestive succession of human faces, and the brisk throb of human life</p><p>
in which I shared; my dinner at the Albion, where I had a hundred</p><p>
dishes at command, and could banquet as delicately as the wizard</p><p>
Michael Scott when the Devil fed him from the king of France's kitchen;</p><p>
my evening at the billiard club, the concert, the theatre, or at</p><p>
somebody's party, if I pleased,--what could be better than all this?</p><p>
Was it better to hoe, to mow, to toil and moil amidst the accumulations</p><p>
of a barnyard; to be the chambermaid of two yoke of oxen and a dozen</p><p>
cows; to eat salt beef, and earn it with the sweat of my brow, and</p><p>
thereby take the tough morsel out of some wretch's mouth, into whose</p><p>
vocation I had thrust myself?  Above all, was it better to have a fever</p><p>
and die blaspheming, as I was like to do?</p>
<p>
In this wretched plight, with a furnace in my heart and another in my</p><p>
head, by the heat of which I was kept constantly at the boiling point,</p><p>
yet shivering at the bare idea of extruding so much as a finger into</p><p>
the icy atmosphere of the room, I kept my bed until breakfast-time,</p><p>
when Hollingsworth knocked at the door, and entered.</p>
<p>
"Well, Coverdale," cried he, "you bid fair to make an admirable farmer!</p><p>
Don't you mean to get up to-day?"</p>
<p>
"Neither to-day nor to-morrow," said I hopelessly.  "I doubt if I ever</p><p>
rise again!"</p>
<p>
"What is the matter now?" he asked.</p>
<p>
I told him my piteous case, and besought him to send me back to town in</p><p>
a close carriage.</p>
<p>
"No, no!" said Hollingsworth with kindly seriousness.  "If you are</p><p>
really sick, we must take care of you."</p>
<p>
Accordingly he built a fire in my chamber, and, having little else to</p><p>
do while the snow lay on the ground, established himself as my nurse. A</p><p>
doctor was sent for, who, being homaeopathic, gave me as much medicine,</p><p>
in the course of a fortnight's attendance, as would have laid on the</p><p>
point of a needle.  They fed me on water-gruel, and I speedily became a</p><p>
skeleton above ground.  But, after all, I have many precious</p><p>
recollections connected with that fit of sickness.</p>
<p>
Hollingsworth's more than brotherly attendance gave me inexpressible</p><p>
comfort.  Most men--and certainly I could not always claim to be one of</p><p>
the exceptions--have a natural indifference, if not an absolutely</p><p>
hostile feeling, towards those whom disease, or weakness, or calamity</p><p>
of any kind causes to falter and faint amid the rude jostle of our</p><p>
selfish existence.  The education of Christianity, it is true, the</p><p>
sympathy of a like experience and the example of women, may soften and,</p><p>
possibly, subvert this ugly characteristic of our sex; but it is</p><p>
originally there, and has likewise its analogy in the practice of our</p><p>
brute brethren, who hunt the sick or disabled member of the herd from</p><p>
among them, as an enemy.  It is for this reason that the stricken deer</p><p>
goes apart, and the sick lion grimly withdraws himself into his den.</p><p>
Except in love, or the attachments of kindred, or other very long and</p><p>
habitual affection, we really have no tenderness.  But there was</p><p>
something of the woman moulded into the great, stalwart frame of</p><p>
Hollingsworth; nor was he ashamed of it, as men often are of what is</p><p>
best in them, nor seemed ever to know that there was such a soft place</p><p>
in his heart.  I knew it well, however, at that time, although</p><p>
afterwards it came nigh to be forgotten.  Methought there could not be</p><p>
two such men alive as Hollingsworth.  There never was any blaze of a</p><p>
fireside that warmed and cheered me, in the down-sinkings and</p><p>
shiverings of my spirit, so effectually as did the light out of those</p><p>
eyes, which lay so deep and dark under his shaggy brows.</p>
<p>
Happy the man that has such a friend beside him when he comes to die!</p><p>
and unless a friend like Hollingsworth be at hand,--as most probably</p><p>
there will not,--he had better make up his mind to die alone.  How many</p><p>
men, I wonder, does one meet with in a lifetime, whom he would choose</p><p>
for his deathbed companions!  At the crisis of my fever I besought</p><p>
Hollingsworth to let nobody else enter the room, but continually to</p><p>
make me sensible of his own presence by a grasp of the hand, a word, a</p><p>
prayer, if he thought good to utter it; and that then he should be the</p><p>
witness how courageously I would encounter the worst. It still</p><p>
impresses me as almost a matter of regret that I did not die then, when</p><p>
I had tolerably made up my mind to it; for Hollingsworth would have</p><p>
gone with me to the hither verge of life, and have sent his friendly</p><p>
and hopeful accents far over on the other side, while I should be</p><p>
treading the unknown path.  Now, were I to send for him, he would</p><p>
hardly come to my bedside, nor should I depart the easier for his</p><p>
presence.</p>
<p>
"You are not going to die, this time," said he, gravely smiling. "You</p><p>
know nothing about sickness, and think your case a great deal more</p><p>
desperate than it is."</p>
<p>
"Death should take me while I am in the mood," replied I, with a little</p><p>
of my customary levity.</p>
<p>
"Have you nothing to do in life," asked Hollingsworth, "that you fancy</p><p>
yourself so ready to leave it?"</p>
<p>
"Nothing," answered I; "nothing that I know of, unless to make pretty</p><p>
verses, and play a part, with Zenobia and the rest of the amateurs, in</p><p>
our pastoral.  It seems but an unsubstantial sort of business, as</p><p>
viewed through a mist of fever.  But, dear Hollingsworth, your own</p><p>
vocation is evidently to be a priest, and to spend your days and nights</p><p>
in helping your fellow creatures to draw peaceful dying breaths."</p>
<p>
"And by which of my qualities," inquired he, "can you suppose me fitted</p><p>
for this awful ministry?"</p>
<p>
"By your tenderness," I said.  "It seems to me the reflection of God's</p><p>
own love."</p>
<p>
"And you call me tender!" repeated Hollingsworth thoughtfully.  "I</p><p>
should rather say that the most marked trait in my character is an</p><p>
inflexible severity of purpose.  Mortal man has no right to be so</p><p>
inflexible as it is my nature and necessity to be."</p>
<p>
"I do not believe it," I replied.</p>
<p>
But, in due time, I remembered what he said.</p>
<p>
Probably, as Hollingsworth suggested, my disorder was never so serious</p><p>
as, in my ignorance of such matters, I was inclined to consider it.</p><p>
After so much tragical preparation, it was positively rather mortifying</p><p>
to find myself on the mending hand.</p>
<p>
All the other members of the Community showed me kindness, according to</p><p>
the full measure of their capacity.  Zenobia brought me my gruel every</p><p>
day, made by her own hands (not very skilfully, if the truth must be</p><p>
told), and, whenever I seemed inclined to converse, would sit by my</p><p>
bedside, and talk with so much vivacity as to add several gratuitous</p><p>
throbs to my pulse.  Her poor little stories and tracts never half did</p><p>
justice to her intellect.  It was only the lack of a fitter avenue that</p><p>
drove her to seek development in literature.  She was made (among a</p><p>
thousand other things that she might have been) for a stump oratress.</p><p>
I recognized no severe culture in Zenobia; her mind was full of weeds.</p><p>
It startled me sometimes, in my state of moral as well as bodily</p><p>
faint-heartedness, to observe the hardihood of her philosophy.  She</p><p>
made no scruple of oversetting all human institutions, and scattering</p><p>
them as with a breeze from her fan.  A female reformer, in her attacks</p><p>
upon society, has an instinctive sense of where the life lies, and is</p><p>
inclined to aim directly at that spot.  Especially the relation between</p><p>
the sexes is naturally among the earliest to attract her notice.</p>
<p>
Zenobia was truly a magnificent woman.  The homely simplicity of her</p><p>
dress could not conceal, nor scarcely diminish, the queenliness of her</p><p>
presence.  The image of her form and face should have been multiplied</p><p>
all over the earth.  It was wronging the rest of mankind to retain her</p><p>
as the spectacle of only a few.  The stage would have been her proper</p><p>
sphere.  She should have made it a point of duty, moreover, to sit</p><p>
endlessly to painters and sculptors, and preferably to the latter;</p><p>
because the cold decorum of the marble would consist with the utmost</p><p>
scantiness of drapery, so that the eye might chastely be gladdened with</p><p>
her material perfection in its entireness.  I know not well how to</p><p>
express that the native glow of coloring in her cheeks, and even the</p><p>
flesh-warmth over her round arms, and what was visible of her full</p><p>
bust,--in a word, her womanliness incarnated,--compelled me sometimes</p><p>
to close my eyes, as if it were not quite the privilege of modesty to</p><p>
gaze at her.  Illness and exhaustion, no doubt, had made me morbidly</p><p>
sensitive.</p>
<p>
I noticed--and wondered how Zenobia contrived it--that she had always a</p><p>
new flower in her hair.  And still it was a hot-house flower,--an</p><p>
outlandish flower,--a flower of the tropics, such as appeared to have</p><p>
sprung passionately out of a soil the very weeds of which would be</p><p>
fervid and spicy.  Unlike as was the flower of each successive day to</p><p>
the preceding one, it yet so assimilated its richness to the rich</p><p>
beauty of the woman, that I thought it the only flower fit to be worn;</p><p>
so fit, indeed, that Nature had evidently created this floral gem, in a</p><p>
happy exuberance, for the one purpose of worthily adorning Zenobia's</p><p>
head.  It might be that my feverish fantasies clustered themselves</p><p>
about this peculiarity, and caused it to look more gorgeous and</p><p>
wonderful than if beheld with temperate eyes.  In the height of my</p><p>
illness, as I well recollect, I went so far as to pronounce it</p><p>
preternatural.</p>
<p>
"Zenobia is an enchantress!" whispered I once to Hollingsworth.  "She</p><p>
is a sister of the Veiled Lady.  That flower in her hair is a talisman.</p><p>
If you were to snatch it away, she would vanish, or be transformed into</p><p>
something else."</p>
<p>
"What does he say?" asked Zenobia.</p>
<p>
"Nothing that has an atom of sense in it," answered Hollingsworth. "He</p><p>
is a little beside himself, I believe, and talks about your being a</p><p>
witch, and of some magical property in the flower that you wear in your</p><p>
hair."</p>
<p>
"It is an idea worthy of a feverish poet," said she, laughing rather</p><p>
compassionately, and taking out the flower.  "I scorn to owe anything</p><p>
to magic.  Here, Mr. Hollingsworth, you may keep the spell while it has</p><p>
any virtue in it; but I cannot promise you not to appear with a new one</p><p>
to-morrow.  It is the one relic of my more brilliant, my happier days!"</p>
<p>
The most curious part of the matter was that, long after my slight</p><p>
delirium had passed away,--as long, indeed, as I continued to know this</p><p>
remarkable woman,--her daily flower affected my imagination, though</p><p>
more slightly, yet in very much the same way.  The reason must have</p><p>
been that, whether intentionally on her part or not, this favorite</p><p>
ornament was actually a subtile expression of Zenobia's character.</p>
<p>
One subject, about which--very impertinently, moreover--I perplexed</p><p>
myself with a great many conjectures, was, whether Zenobia had ever</p><p>
been married.  The idea, it must be understood, was unauthorized by any</p><p>
circumstance or suggestion that had made its way to my ears.  So young</p><p>
as I beheld her, and the freshest and rosiest woman of a thousand,</p><p>
there was certainly no need of imputing to her a destiny already</p><p>
accomplished; the probability was far greater that her coming years had</p><p>
all life's richest gifts to bring.  If the great event of a woman's</p><p>
existence had been consummated, the world knew nothing of it, although</p><p>
the world seemed to know Zenobia well.  It was a ridiculous piece of</p><p>
romance, undoubtedly, to imagine that this beautiful personage, wealthy</p><p>
as she was, and holding a position that might fairly enough be called</p><p>
distinguished, could have given herself away so privately, but that</p><p>
some whisper and suspicion, and by degrees a full understanding of the</p><p>
fact, would eventually be blown abroad. But then, as I failed not to</p><p>
consider, her original home was at a distance of many hundred miles.</p><p>
Rumors might fill the social atmosphere, or might once have filled it,</p><p>
there, which would travel but slowly, against the wind, towards our</p><p>
Northeastern metropolis, and perhaps melt into thin air before reaching</p><p>
it.</p>
<p>
There was not--and I distinctly repeat it--the slightest foundation in</p><p>
my knowledge for any surmise of the kind.  But there is a species of</p><p>
intuition,--either a spiritual lie or the subtile recognition of a</p><p>
fact,--which comes to us in a reduced state of the corporeal system.</p><p>
The soul gets the better of the body, after wasting illness, or when a</p><p>
vegetable diet may have mingled too much ether in the blood. Vapors</p><p>
then rise up to the brain, and take shapes that often image falsehood,</p><p>
but sometimes truth.  The spheres of our companions have, at such</p><p>
periods, a vastly greater influence upon our own than when robust</p><p>
health gives us a repellent and self-defensive energy. Zenobia's</p><p>
sphere, I imagine, impressed itself powerfully on mine, and transformed</p><p>
me, during this period of my weakness, into something like a mesmerical</p><p>
clairvoyant.</p>
<p>
Then, also, as anybody could observe, the freedom of her deportment</p><p>
(though, to some tastes, it might commend itself as the utmost</p><p>
perfection of manner in a youthful widow or a blooming matron) was not</p><p>
exactly maiden-like.  What girl had ever laughed as Zenobia did? What</p><p>
girl had ever spoken in her mellow tones?  Her unconstrained and</p><p>
inevitable manifestation, I said often to myself, was that of a woman</p><p>
to whom wedlock had thrown wide the gates of mystery.  Yet sometimes I</p><p>
strove to be ashamed of these conjectures.  I acknowledged it as a</p><p>
masculine grossness--a sin of wicked interpretation, of which man is</p><p>
often guilty towards the other sex--thus to mistake the sweet, liberal,</p><p>
but womanly frankness of a noble and generous disposition. Still, it</p><p>
was of no avail to reason with myself nor to upbraid myself.</p><p>
Pertinaciously the thought, "Zenobia is a wife; Zenobia has lived and</p><p>
loved!  There is no folded petal, no latent dewdrop, in this perfectly</p><p>
developed rose!"--irresistibly that thought drove out all other</p><p>
conclusions, as often as my mind reverted to the subject.</p>
<p>
Zenobia was conscious of my observation, though not, I presume, of the</p><p>
point to which it led me.</p>
<p>
"Mr. Coverdale," said she one day, as she saw me watching her, while</p><p>
she arranged my gruel on the table, "I have been exposed to a great</p><p>
deal of eye-shot in the few years of my mixing in the world, but never,</p><p>
I think, to precisely such glances as you are in the habit of favoring</p><p>
me with.  I seem to interest you very much; and yet--or else a woman's</p><p>
instinct is for once deceived--I cannot reckon you as an admirer.  What</p><p>
are you seeking to discover in me?"</p>
<p>
"The mystery of your life," answered I, surprised into the truth by the</p><p>
unexpectedness of her attack.  "And you will never tell me."</p>
<p>
She bent her head towards me, and let me look into her eyes, as if</p><p>
challenging me to drop a plummet-line down into the depths of her</p><p>
consciousness.</p>
<p>
"I see nothing now," said I, closing my own eyes, "unless it be the</p><p>
face of a sprite laughing at me from the bottom of a deep well."</p>
<p>
A bachelor always feels himself defrauded, when he knows or suspects</p><p>
that any woman of his acquaintance has given herself away.  Otherwise,</p><p>
the matter could have been no concern of mine.  It was purely</p><p>
speculative, for I should not, under any circumstances, have fallen in</p><p>
love with Zenobia.  The riddle made me so nervous, however, in my</p><p>
sensitive condition of mind and body, that I most ungratefully began to</p><p>
wish that she would let me alone.  Then, too, her gruel was very</p><p>
wretched stuff, with almost invariably the smell of pine smoke upon it,</p><p>
like the evil taste that is said to mix itself up with a witch's best</p><p>
concocted dainties.  Why could not she have allowed one of the other</p><p>
women to take the gruel in charge?  Whatever else might be her gifts,</p><p>
Nature certainly never intended Zenobia for a cook.  Or, if so, she</p><p>
should have meddled only with the richest and spiciest dishes, and such</p><p>
as are to be tasted at banquets, between draughts of intoxicating wine.</p>
<p>
VII. THE CONVALESCENT</p>
<p>
As soon as my incommodities allowed me to think of past occurrences, I</p><p>
failed not to inquire what had become of the odd little guest whom</p><p>
Hollingsworth had been the medium of introducing among us.  It now</p><p>
appeared that poor Priscilla had not so literally fallen out of the</p><p>
clouds, as we were at first inclined to suppose.  A letter, which</p><p>
should have introduced her, had since been received from one of the</p><p>
city missionaries, containing a certificate of character and an</p><p>
allusion to circumstances which, in the writer's judgment, made it</p><p>
especially desirable that she should find shelter in our Community.</p><p>
There was a hint, not very intelligible, implying either that Priscilla</p><p>
had recently escaped from some particular peril or irksomeness of</p><p>
position, or else that she was still liable to this danger or</p><p>
difficulty, whatever it might be.  We should ill have deserved the</p><p>
reputation of a benevolent fraternity, had we hesitated to entertain a</p><p>
petitioner in such need, and so strongly recommended to our kindness;</p><p>
not to mention, moreover, that the strange maiden had set herself</p><p>
diligently to work, and was doing good service with her needle.  But a</p><p>
slight mist of uncertainty still floated about Priscilla, and kept her,</p><p>
as yet, from taking a very decided place among creatures of flesh and</p><p>
blood.</p>
<p>
The mysterious attraction, which, from her first entrance on our scene,</p><p>
she evinced for Zenobia, had lost nothing of its force.  I often heard</p><p>
her footsteps, soft and low, accompanying the light but decided tread</p><p>
of the latter up the staircase, stealing along the passage-way by her</p><p>
new friend's side, and pausing while Zenobia entered my chamber.</p><p>
Occasionally Zenobia would be a little annoyed by Priscilla's too close</p><p>
attendance.  In an authoritative and not very kindly tone, she would</p><p>
advise her to breathe the pleasant air in a walk, or to go with her</p><p>
work into the barn, holding out half a promise to come and sit on the</p><p>
hay with her, when at leisure. Evidently, Priscilla found but scanty</p><p>
requital for her love. Hollingsworth was likewise a great favorite with</p><p>
her.  For several minutes together sometimes, while my auditory nerves</p><p>
retained the susceptibility of delicate health, I used to hear a low,</p><p>
pleasant murmur ascending from the room below; and at last ascertained</p><p>
it to be Priscilla's voice, babbling like a little brook to</p><p>
Hollingsworth. She talked more largely and freely with him than with</p><p>
Zenobia, towards whom, indeed, her feelings seemed not so much to be</p><p>
confidence as involuntary affection.  I should have thought all the</p><p>
better of my own qualities had Priscilla marked me out for the third</p><p>
place in her regards.  But, though she appeared to like me tolerably</p><p>
well, I could never flatter myself with being distinguished by her as</p><p>
Hollingsworth and Zenobia were.</p>
<p>
One forenoon, during my convalescence, there came a gentle tap at my</p><p>
chamber door.  I immediately said, "Come in, Priscilla!" with an acute</p><p>
sense of the applicant's identity.  Nor was I deceived.  It was really</p><p>
Priscilla,--a pale, large-eyed little woman (for she had gone far</p><p>
enough into her teens to be, at least, on the outer limit of girlhood),</p><p>
but much less wan than at my previous view of her, and far better</p><p>
conditioned both as to health and spirits.  As I first saw her, she had</p><p>
reminded me of plants that one sometimes observes doing their best to</p><p>
vegetate among the bricks of an enclosed court, where there is scanty</p><p>
soil and never any sunshine.  At present, though with no approach to</p><p>
bloom, there were indications that the girl had human blood in her</p><p>
veins.</p>
<p>
Priscilla came softly to my bedside, and held out an article of</p><p>
snow-white linen, very carefully and smoothly ironed.  She did not seem</p><p>
bashful, nor anywise embarrassed.  My weakly condition, I suppose,</p><p>
supplied a medium in which she could approach me.</p>
<p>
"Do not you need this?" asked she.  "I have made it for you."  It was a</p><p>
nightcap!</p>
<p>
"My dear Priscilla," said I, smiling, "I never had on a nightcap in my</p><p>
life!  But perhaps it will be better for me to wear one, now that I am</p><p>
a miserable invalid.  How admirably you have done it!  No, no; I never</p><p>
can think of wearing such an exquisitely wrought nightcap as this,</p><p>
unless it be in the daytime, when I sit up to receive company."</p>
<p>
"It is for use, not beauty," answered Priscilla.  "I could have</p><p>
embroidered it and made it much prettier, if I pleased."</p>
<p>
While holding up the nightcap and admiring the fine needlework, I</p><p>
perceived that Priscilla had a sealed letter which she was waiting for</p><p>
me to take.  It had arrived from the village post-office that morning.</p><p>
As I did not immediately offer to receive the letter, she drew it back,</p><p>
and held it against her bosom, with both hands clasped over it, in a</p><p>
way that had probably grown habitual to her.  Now, on turning my eyes</p><p>
from the nightcap to Priscilla, it forcibly struck me that her air,</p><p>
though not her figure, and the expression of her face, but not its</p><p>
features, had a resemblance to what I had often seen in a friend of</p><p>
mine, one of the most gifted women of the age.  I cannot describe it.</p><p>
The points easiest to convey to the reader were a certain curve of the</p><p>
shoulders and a partial closing of the eyes, which seemed to look more</p><p>
penetratingly into my own eyes, through the narrowed apertures, than if</p><p>
they had been open at full width.  It was a singular anomaly of</p><p>
likeness coexisting with perfect dissimilitude.</p>
<p>
"Will you give me the letter, Priscilla?" said I.</p>
<p>
She started, put the letter into my hand, and quite lost the look that</p><p>
had drawn my notice.</p>
<p>
"Priscilla," I inquired, "did you ever see Miss Margaret Fuller?"</p>
<p>
"No," she answered.</p>
<p>
"Because," said I, "you reminded me of her just now,--and it happens,</p><p>
strangely enough, that this very letter is from her."</p>
<p>
Priscilla, for whatever reason, looked very much discomposed.</p>
<p>
"I wish people would not fancy such odd things in me!" she said rather</p><p>
petulantly.  "How could I possibly make myself resemble this lady</p><p>
merely by holding her letter in my hand?"</p>
<p>
"Certainly, Priscilla, it would puzzle me to explain it," I replied;</p><p>
"nor do I suppose that the letter had anything to do with it.  It was</p><p>
just a coincidence, nothing more."</p>
<p>
She hastened out of the room, and this was the last that I saw of</p><p>
Priscilla until I ceased to be an invalid.</p>
<p>
Being much alone during my recovery, I read interminably in Mr.</p><p>
Emerson's Essays, "The Dial," Carlyle's works, George Sand's romances</p><p>
(lent me by Zenobia), and other books which one or another of the</p><p>
brethren or sisterhood had brought with them.  Agreeing in little else,</p><p>
most of these utterances were like the cry of some solitary sentinel,</p><p>
whose station was on the outposts of the advance guard of human</p><p>
progression; or sometimes the voice came sadly from among the shattered</p><p>
ruins of the past, but yet had a hopeful echo in the future. They were</p><p>
well adapted (better, at least, than any other intellectual products,</p><p>
the volatile essence of which had heretofore tinctured a printed page)</p><p>
to pilgrims like ourselves, whose present bivouac was considerably</p><p>
further into the waste of chaos than any mortal army of crusaders had</p><p>
ever marched before.  Fourier's works, also, in a series of horribly</p><p>
tedious volumes, attracted a good deal of my attention, from the</p><p>
analogy which I could not but recognize between his system and our own.</p><p>
There was far less resemblance, it is true, than the world chose to</p><p>
imagine, inasmuch as the two theories differed, as widely as the zenith</p><p>
from the nadir, in their main principles.</p>
<p>
I talked about Fourier to Hollingsworth, and translated, for his</p><p>
benefit, some of the passages that chiefly impressed me.</p>
<p>
"When, as a consequence of human improvement," said I, "the globe shall</p><p>
arrive at its final perfection, the great ocean is to be converted into</p><p>
a particular kind of lemonade, such as was fashionable at Paris in</p><p>
Fourier's time.  He calls it limonade a cedre.  It is positively a</p><p>
fact!  Just imagine the city docks filled, every day, with a flood tide</p><p>
of this delectable beverage!"</p>
<p>
"Why did not the Frenchman make punch of it at once?" asked</p><p>
Hollingsworth.  "The jack-tars would be delighted to go down in ships</p><p>
and do business in such an element."</p>
<p>
I further proceeded to explain, as well as I modestly could, several</p><p>
points of Fourier's system, illustrating them with here and there a</p><p>
page or two, and asking Hollingsworth's opinion as to the expediency of</p><p>
introducing these beautiful peculiarities into our own practice.</p>
<p>
"Let me hear no more of it!" cried he, in utter disgust.  "I never will</p><p>
forgive this fellow!  He has committed the unpardonable sin; for what</p><p>
more monstrous iniquity could the Devil himself contrive than to choose</p><p>
the selfish principle,--the principle of all human wrong, the very</p><p>
blackness of man's heart, the portion of ourselves which we shudder at,</p><p>
and which it is the whole aim of spiritual discipline to eradicate,--to</p><p>
choose it as the master workman of his system?  To seize upon and</p><p>
foster whatever vile, petty, sordid, filthy, bestial, and abominable</p><p>
corruptions have cankered into our nature, to be the efficient</p><p>
instruments of his infernal regeneration!  And his consummated</p><p>
Paradise, as he pictures it, would be worthy of the agency which he</p><p>
counts upon for establishing it.  The nauseous villain!"</p>
<p>
"Nevertheless," remarked I, "in consideration of the promised delights</p><p>
of his system,--so very proper, as they certainly are, to be</p><p>
appreciated by Fourier's countrymen,--I cannot but wonder that</p><p>
universal France did not adopt his theory at a moment's warning.  But</p><p>
is there not something very characteristic of his nation in Fourier's</p><p>
manner of putting forth his views?  He makes no claim to inspiration.</p><p>
He has not persuaded himself--as Swedenborg did, and as any other than</p><p>
a Frenchman would, with a mission of like importance to</p><p>
communicate--that he speaks with authority from above.  He promulgates</p><p>
his system, so far as I can perceive, entirely on his own</p><p>
responsibility.  He has searched out and discovered the whole counsel</p><p>
of the Almighty in respect to mankind, past, present, and for exactly</p><p>
seventy thousand years to come, by the mere force and cunning of his</p><p>
individual intellect!"</p>
<p>
"Take the book out of my sight," said Hollingsworth with great</p><p>
virulence of expression, "or, I tell you fairly, I shall fling it in</p><p>
the fire!  And as for Fourier, let him make a Paradise, if he can, of</p><p>
Gehenna, where, as I conscientiously believe, he is floundering at this</p><p>
moment!"</p>
<p>
"And bellowing, I suppose," said I,--not that I felt any ill-will</p><p>
towards Fourier, but merely wanted to give the finishing touch to</p><p>
Hollingsworth's image, "bellowing for the least drop of his beloved</p><p>
limonade a cedre!"</p>
<p>
There is but little profit to be expected in attempting to argue with a</p><p>
man who allows himself to declaim in this manner; so I dropt the</p><p>
subject, and never took it up again.</p>
<p>
But had the system at which he was so enraged combined almost any</p><p>
amount of human wisdom, spiritual insight, and imaginative beauty, I</p><p>
question whether Hollingsworth's mind was in a fit condition to receive</p><p>
it.  I began to discern that he had come among us actuated by no real</p><p>
sympathy with our feelings and our hopes, but chiefly because we were</p><p>
estranging ourselves from the world, with which his lonely and</p><p>
exclusive object in life had already put him at odds. Hollingsworth</p><p>
must have been originally endowed with a great spirit of benevolence,</p><p>
deep enough and warm enough to be the source of as much disinterested</p><p>
good as Providence often allows a human being the privilege of</p><p>
conferring upon his fellows.  This native instinct yet lived within</p><p>
him.  I myself had profited by it, in my necessity.  It was seen, too,</p><p>
in his treatment of Priscilla.  Such casual circumstances as were here</p><p>
involved would quicken his divine power of sympathy, and make him seem,</p><p>
while their influence lasted, the tenderest man and the truest friend</p><p>
on earth.  But by and by you missed the tenderness of yesterday, and</p><p>
grew drearily conscious that Hollingsworth had a closer friend than</p><p>
ever you could be; and this friend was the cold, spectral monster which</p><p>
he had himself conjured up, and on which he was wasting all the warmth</p><p>
of his heart, and of which, at last,--as these men of a mighty purpose</p><p>
so invariably do,--he had grown to be the bond-slave.  It was his</p><p>
philanthropic theory.</p>
<p>
This was a result exceedingly sad to contemplate, considering that it</p><p>
had been mainly brought about by the very ardor and exuberance of his</p><p>
philanthropy.  Sad, indeed, but by no means unusual: he had taught his</p><p>
benevolence to pour its warm tide exclusively through one channel; so</p><p>
that there was nothing to spare for other great manifestations of love</p><p>
to man, nor scarcely for the nutriment of individual attachments,</p><p>
unless they could minister in some way to the terrible egotism which he</p><p>
mistook for an angel of God.  Had Hollingsworth's education been more</p><p>
enlarged, he might not so inevitably have stumbled into this pitfall.</p><p>
But this identical pursuit had educated him.  He knew absolutely</p><p>
nothing, except in a single direction, where he had thought so</p><p>
energetically, and felt to such a depth, that no doubt the entire</p><p>
reason and justice of the universe appeared to be concentrated</p><p>
thitherward.</p>
<p>
It is my private opinion that, at this period of his life,</p><p>
Hollingsworth was fast going mad; and, as with other crazy people</p><p>
(among whom I include humorists of every degree), it required all the</p><p>
constancy of friendship to restrain his associates from pronouncing him</p><p>
an intolerable bore.  Such prolonged fiddling upon one string--such</p><p>
multiform presentation of one idea!  His specific object (of which he</p><p>
made the public more than sufficiently aware, through the medium of</p><p>
lectures and pamphlets) was to obtain funds for the construction of an</p><p>
edifice, with a sort of collegiate endowment.  On this foundation he</p><p>
purposed to devote himself and a few disciples to the reform and mental</p><p>
culture of our criminal brethren.  His visionary edifice was</p><p>
Hollingsworth's one castle in the air; it was the material type in</p><p>
which his philanthropic dream strove to embody itself; and he made the</p><p>
scheme more definite, and caught hold of it the more strongly, and kept</p><p>
his clutch the more pertinaciously, by rendering it visible to the</p><p>
bodily eye.  I have seen him, a hundred times, with a pencil and sheet</p><p>
of paper, sketching the facade, the side-view, or the rear of the</p><p>
structure, or planning the internal arrangements, as lovingly as</p><p>
another man might plan those of the projected home where he meant to be</p><p>
happy with his wife and children. I have known him to begin a model of</p><p>
the building with little stones, gathered at the brookside, whither we</p><p>
had gone to cool ourselves in the sultry noon of haying-time.  Unlike</p><p>
all other ghosts, his spirit haunted an edifice, which, instead of</p><p>
being time-worn, and full of storied love, and joy, and sorrow, had</p><p>
never yet come into existence.</p>
<p>
"Dear friend," said I once to Hollingsworth, before leaving my</p><p>
sick-chamber, "I heartily wish that I could make your schemes my</p><p>
schemes, because it would be so great a happiness to find myself</p><p>
treading the same path with you.  But I am afraid there is not stuff in</p><p>
me stern enough for a philanthropist,--or not in this peculiar</p><p>
direction,--or, at all events, not solely in this.  Can you bear with</p><p>
me, if such should prove to be the case?"</p>
<p>
"I will at least wait awhile," answered Hollingsworth, gazing at me</p><p>
sternly and gloomily.  "But how can you be my life-long friend, except</p><p>
you strive with me towards the great object of my life?"</p>
<p>
Heaven forgive me!  A horrible suspicion crept into my heart, and stung</p><p>
the very core of it as with the fangs of an adder.  I wondered whether</p><p>
it were possible that Hollingsworth could have watched by my bedside,</p><p>
with all that devoted care, only for the ulterior purpose of making me</p><p>
a proselyte to his views!</p>
<p>
VIII. A MODERN ARCADIA</p>
<p>
May-day--I forget whether by Zenobia's sole decree, or by the unanimous</p><p>
vote of our community--had been declared a movable festival. It was</p><p>
deferred until the sun should have had a reasonable time to clear away</p><p>
the snowdrifts along the lee of the stone walls, and bring out a few of</p><p>
the readiest wild flowers.  On the forenoon of the substituted day,</p><p>
after admitting some of the balmy air into my chamber, I decided that</p><p>
it was nonsense and effeminacy to keep myself a prisoner any longer.</p><p>
So I descended to the sitting-room, and finding nobody there, proceeded</p><p>
to the barn, whence I had already heard Zenobia's voice, and along with</p><p>
it a girlish laugh which was not so certainly recognizable.  Arriving</p><p>
at the spot, it a little surprised me to discover that these merry</p><p>
outbreaks came from Priscilla.</p>
<p>
The two had been a-maying together.  They had found anemones in</p><p>
abundance, houstonias by the handful, some columbines, a few</p><p>
long-stalked violets, and a quantity of white everlasting flowers, and</p><p>
had filled up their basket with the delicate spray of shrubs and trees.</p><p>
None were prettier than the maple twigs, the leaf of which looks like a</p><p>
scarlet bud in May, and like a plate of vegetable gold in October.</p><p>
Zenobia, who showed no conscience in such matters, had also rifled a</p><p>
cherry-tree of one of its blossomed boughs, and, with all this variety</p><p>
of sylvan ornament, had been decking out Priscilla. Being done with a</p><p>
good deal of taste, it made her look more charming than I should have</p><p>
thought possible, with my recollection of the wan, frost-nipt girl, as</p><p>
heretofore described.  Nevertheless, among those fragrant blossoms, and</p><p>
conspicuously, too, had been stuck a weed of evil odor and ugly aspect,</p><p>
which, as soon as I detected it, destroyed the effect of all the rest.</p><p>
There was a gleam of latent mischief--not to call it deviltry--in</p><p>
Zenobia's eye, which seemed to indicate a slightly malicious purpose in</p><p>
the arrangement.</p>
<p>
As for herself, she scorned the rural buds and leaflets, and wore</p><p>
nothing but her invariable flower of the tropics.</p>
<p>
"What do you think of Priscilla now, Mr. Coverdale?" asked she,</p><p>
surveying her as a child does its doll.  "Is not she worth a verse or</p><p>
two?"</p>
<p>
"There is only one thing amiss," answered I. Zenobia laughed, and flung</p><p>
the malignant weed away.</p>
<p>
"Yes; she deserves some verses now," said I, "and from a better poet</p><p>
than myself.  She is the very picture of the New England spring;</p><p>
subdued in tint and rather cool, but with a capacity of sunshine, and</p><p>
bringing us a few Alpine blossoms, as earnest of something richer,</p><p>
though hardly more beautiful, hereafter.  The best type of her is one</p><p>
of those anemones."</p>
<p>
"What I find most singular in Priscilla, as her health improves,"</p><p>
observed Zenobia, "is her wildness.  Such a quiet little body as she</p><p>
seemed, one would not have expected that.  Why, as we strolled the</p><p>
woods together, I could hardly keep her from scrambling up the trees,</p><p>
like a squirrel.  She has never before known what it is to live in the</p><p>
free air, and so it intoxicates her as if she were sipping wine. And</p><p>
she thinks it such a paradise here, and all of us, particularly Mr.</p><p>
Hollingsworth and myself, such angels!  It is quite ridiculous, and</p><p>
provokes one's malice almost, to see a creature so happy, especially a</p><p>
feminine creature."</p>
<p>
"They are always happier than male creatures," said I.</p>
<p>
"You must correct that opinion, Mr. Coverdale," replied Zenobia</p><p>
contemptuously, "or I shall think you lack the poetic insight.  Did you</p><p>
ever see a happy woman in your life?  Of course, I do not mean a girl,</p><p>
like Priscilla and a thousand others,--for they are all alike, while on</p><p>
the sunny side of experience,--but a grown woman.  How can she be</p><p>
happy, after discovering that fate has assigned her but one single</p><p>
event, which she must contrive to make the substance of her whole life?</p><p>
A man has his choice of innumerable events."</p>
<p>
"A woman, I suppose," answered I, "by constant repetition of her one</p><p>
event, may compensate for the lack of variety."</p>
<p>
"Indeed!" said Zenobia.</p>
<p>
While we were talking, Priscilla caught sight of Hollingsworth at a</p><p>
distance, in a blue frock, and with a hoe over his shoulder, returning</p><p>
from the field.  She immediately set out to meet him, running and</p><p>
skipping, with spirits as light as the breeze of the May morning, but</p><p>
with limbs too little exercised to be quite responsive; she clapped her</p><p>
hands, too, with great exuberance of gesture, as is the custom of young</p><p>
girls when their electricity overcharges them. But, all at once, midway</p><p>
to Hollingsworth, she paused, looked round about her, towards the</p><p>
river, the road, the woods, and back towards us, appearing to listen,</p><p>
as if she heard some one calling her name, and knew not precisely in</p><p>
what direction.</p>
<p>
"Have you bewitched her?"  I exclaimed.</p>
<p>
"It is no sorcery of mine," said Zenobia; "but I have seen the girl do</p><p>
that identical thing once or twice before.  Can you imagine what is the</p><p>
matter with her?"</p>
<p>
"No; unless," said I, "she has the gift of hearing those 'airy tongues</p><p>
that syllable men's names,' which Milton tells about."</p>
<p>
From whatever cause, Priscilla's animation seemed entirely to have</p><p>
deserted her.  She seated herself on a rock, and remained there until</p><p>
Hollingsworth came up; and when he took her hand and led her back to</p><p>
us, she rather resembled my original image of the wan and spiritless</p><p>
Priscilla than the flowery May-queen of a few moments ago.  These</p><p>
sudden transformations, only to be accounted for by an extreme nervous</p><p>
susceptibility, always continued to characterize the girl, though with</p><p>
diminished frequency as her health progressively grew more robust.</p>
<p>
I was now on my legs again.  My fit of illness had been an avenue</p><p>
between two existences; the low-arched and darksome doorway, through</p><p>
which I crept out of a life of old conventionalisms, on my hands and</p><p>
knees, as it were, and gained admittance into the freer region that lay</p><p>
beyond.  In this respect, it was like death.  And, as with death, too,</p><p>
it was good to have gone through it.  No otherwise could I have rid</p><p>
myself of a thousand follies, fripperies, prejudices, habits, and other</p><p>
such worldly dust as inevitably settles upon the crowd along the broad</p><p>
highway, giving them all one sordid aspect before noon-time, however</p><p>
freshly they may have begun their pilgrimage in the dewy morning.  The</p><p>
very substance upon my bones had not been fit to live with in any</p><p>
better, truer, or more energetic mode than that to which I was</p><p>
accustomed.  So it was taken off me and flung aside, like any other</p><p>
worn-out or unseasonable garment; and, after shivering a little while</p><p>
in my skeleton, I began to be clothed anew, and much more</p><p>
satisfactorily than in my previous suit.  In literal and physical</p><p>
truth, I was quite another man.  I had a lively sense of the exultation</p><p>
with which the spirit will enter on the next stage of its eternal</p><p>
progress after leaving the heavy burden of its mortality in an early</p><p>
grave, with as little concern for what may become of it as now affected</p><p>
me for the flesh which I had lost.</p>
<p>
Emerging into the genial sunshine, I half fancied that the labors of</p><p>
the brotherhood had already realized some of Fourier's predictions.</p><p>
Their enlightened culture of the soil, and the virtues with which they</p><p>
sanctified their life, had begun to produce an effect upon the material</p><p>
world and its climate.  In my new enthusiasm, man looked strong and</p><p>
stately,--and woman, oh, how beautiful!--and the earth a green garden,</p><p>
blossoming with many-colored delights.  Thus Nature, whose laws I had</p><p>
broken in various artificial ways, comported herself towards me as a</p><p>
strict but loving mother, who uses the rod upon her little boy for his</p><p>
naughtiness, and then gives him a smile, a kiss, and some pretty</p><p>
playthings to console the urchin for her severity.</p>
<p>
In the interval of my seclusion, there had been a number of recruits to</p><p>
our little army of saints and martyrs.  They were mostly individuals</p><p>
who had gone through such an experience as to disgust them with</p><p>
ordinary pursuits, but who were not yet so old, nor had suffered so</p><p>
deeply, as to lose their faith in the better time to come. On comparing</p><p>
their minds one with another they often discovered that this idea of a</p><p>
Community had been growing up, in silent and unknown sympathy, for</p><p>
years.  Thoughtful, strongly lined faces were among them; sombre brows,</p><p>
but eyes that did not require spectacles, unless prematurely dimmed by</p><p>
the student's lamplight, and hair that seldom showed a thread of</p><p>
silver.  Age, wedded to the past, incrusted over with a stony layer of</p><p>
habits, and retaining nothing fluid in its possibilities, would have</p><p>
been absurdly out of place in an enterprise like this.  Youth, too, in</p><p>
its early dawn, was hardly more adapted to our purpose; for it would</p><p>
behold the morning radiance of its own spirit beaming over the very</p><p>
same spots of withered grass and barren sand whence most of us had seen</p><p>
it vanish.  We had very young people with us, it is true,--downy lads,</p><p>
rosy girls in their first teens, and children of all heights above</p><p>
one's knee; but these had chiefly been sent hither for education, which</p><p>
it was one of the objects and methods of our institution to supply.</p><p>
Then we had boarders, from town and elsewhere, who lived with us in a</p><p>
familiar way, sympathized more or less in our theories, and sometimes</p><p>
shared in our labors.</p>
<p>
On the whole, it was a society such as has seldom met together; nor,</p><p>
perhaps, could it reasonably be expected to hold together long. Persons</p><p>
of marked individuality--crooked sticks, as some of us might be</p><p>
called--are not exactly the easiest to bind up into a fagot.  But, so</p><p>
long as our union should subsist, a man of intellect and feeling, with</p><p>
a free nature in him, might have sought far and near without finding so</p><p>
many points of attraction as would allure him hitherward. We were of</p><p>
all creeds and opinions, and generally tolerant of all, on every</p><p>
imaginable subject.  Our bond, it seems to me, was not affirmative, but</p><p>
negative.  We had individually found one thing or another to quarrel</p><p>
with in our past life, and were pretty well agreed as to the</p><p>
inexpediency of lumbering along with the old system any further.  As to</p><p>
what should be substituted, there was much less unanimity.  We did not</p><p>
greatly care--at least, I never did--for the written constitution under</p><p>
which our millennium had commenced.  My hope was, that, between theory</p><p>
and practice, a true and available mode of life might be struck out;</p><p>
and that, even should we ultimately fail, the months or years spent in</p><p>
the trial would not have been wasted, either as regarded passing</p><p>
enjoyment, or the experience which makes men wise.</p>
<p>
Arcadians though we were, our costume bore no resemblance to the</p><p>
beribboned doublets, silk breeches and stockings, and slippers fastened</p><p>
with artificial roses, that distinguish the pastoral people of poetry</p><p>
and the stage.  In outward show, I humbly conceive, we looked rather</p><p>
like a gang of beggars, or banditti, than either a company of honest</p><p>
laboring-men, or a conclave of philosophers. Whatever might be our</p><p>
points of difference, we all of us seemed to have come to Blithedale</p><p>
with the one thrifty and laudable idea of wearing out our old clothes.</p><p>
Such garments as had an airing, whenever we strode afield!  Coats with</p><p>
high collars and with no collars, broad-skirted or swallow-tailed, and</p><p>
with the waist at every point between the hip and arm-pit; pantaloons</p><p>
of a dozen successive epochs, and greatly defaced at the knees by the</p><p>
humiliations of the wearer before his lady-love,--in short, we were a</p><p>
living epitome of defunct fashions, and the very raggedest presentment</p><p>
of men who had seen better days.  It was gentility in tatters.  Often</p><p>
retaining a scholarlike or clerical air, you might have taken us for</p><p>
the denizens of Grub Street, intent on getting a comfortable livelihood</p><p>
by agricultural labor; or Coleridge's projected Pantisocracy in full</p><p>
experiment; or Candide and his motley associates at work in their</p><p>
cabbage garden; or anything else that was miserably out at elbows, and</p><p>
most clumsily patched in the rear.  We might have been sworn comrades</p><p>
to Falstaff's ragged regiment.  Little skill as we boasted in other</p><p>
points of husbandry, every mother's son of us would have served</p><p>
admirably to stick up for a scarecrow.  And the worst of the matter</p><p>
was, that the first energetic movement essential to one downright</p><p>
stroke of real labor was sure to put a finish to these poor</p><p>
habiliments.  So we gradually flung them all aside, and took to honest</p><p>
homespun and linsey-woolsey, as preferable, on the whole, to the plan</p><p>
recommended, I think, by Virgil,--"Ara nudus; sere nudus, "--which as</p><p>
Silas Foster remarked, when I translated the maxim, would be apt to</p><p>
astonish the women-folks.</p>
<p>
After a reasonable training, the yeoman life throve well with us. Our</p><p>
faces took the sunburn kindly; our chests gained in compass, and our</p><p>
shoulders in breadth and squareness; our great brown fists looked as if</p><p>
they had never been capable of kid gloves.  The plough, the hoe, the</p><p>
scythe, and the hay-fork grew familiar to our grasp.  The oxen</p><p>
responded to our voices.  We could do almost as fair a day's work as</p><p>
Silas Foster himself, sleep dreamlessly after it, and awake at daybreak</p><p>
with only a little stiffness of the joints, which was usually quite</p><p>
gone by breakfast-time.</p>
<p>
To be sure, our next neighbors pretended to be incredulous as to our</p><p>
real proficiency in the business which we had taken in hand.  They told</p><p>
slanderous fables about our inability to yoke our own oxen, or to drive</p><p>
them afield when yoked, or to release the poor brutes from their</p><p>
conjugal bond at nightfall.  They had the face to say, too, that the</p><p>
cows laughed at our awkwardness at milking-time, and invariably kicked</p><p>
over the pails; partly in consequence of our putting the stool on the</p><p>
wrong side, and partly because, taking offence at the whisking of their</p><p>
tails, we were in the habit of holding these natural fly-flappers with</p><p>
one hand and milking with the other.  They further averred that we hoed</p><p>
up whole acres of Indian corn and other crops, and drew the earth</p><p>
carefully about the weeds; and that we raised five hundred tufts of</p><p>
burdock, mistaking them for cabbages; and that by dint of unskilful</p><p>
planting few of our seeds ever came up at all, or, if they did come up,</p><p>
it was stern-foremost; and that we spent the better part of the month</p><p>
of June in reversing a field of beans, which had thrust themselves out</p><p>
of the ground in this unseemly way.  They quoted it as nothing more</p><p>
than an ordinary occurrence for one or other of us to crop off two or</p><p>
three fingers, of a morning, by our clumsy use of the hay-cutter.</p><p>
Finally, and as an ultimate catastrophe, these mendacious rogues</p><p>
circulated a report that we communitarians were exterminated, to the</p><p>
last man, by severing ourselves asunder with the sweep of our own</p><p>
scythes! and that the world had lost nothing by this little accident.</p>
<p>
But this was pure envy and malice on the part of the neighboring</p><p>
farmers.  The peril of our new way of life was not lest we should fail</p><p>
in becoming practical agriculturists, but that we should probably cease</p><p>
to be anything else.  While our enterprise lay all in theory, we had</p><p>
pleased ourselves with delectable visions of the spiritualization of</p><p>
labor.  It was to be our form of prayer and ceremonial of worship.</p><p>
Each stroke of the hoe was to uncover some aromatic root of wisdom,</p><p>
heretofore hidden from the sun.  Pausing in the field, to let the wind</p><p>
exhale the moisture from our foreheads, we were to look upward, and</p><p>
catch glimpses into the far-off soul of truth.  In this point of view,</p><p>
matters did not turn out quite so well as we anticipated.  It is very</p><p>
true that, sometimes, gazing casually around me, out of the midst of my</p><p>
toil, I used to discern a richer picturesqueness in the visible scene</p><p>
of earth and sky.  There was, at such moments, a novelty, an unwonted</p><p>
aspect, on the face of Nature, as if she had been taken by surprise and</p><p>
seen at unawares, with no opportunity to put off her real look, and</p><p>
assume the mask with which she mysteriously hides herself from mortals.</p><p>
But this was all.  The clods of earth, which we so constantly belabored</p><p>
and turned over and over, were never etherealized into thought.  Our</p><p>
thoughts, on the contrary, were fast becoming cloddish.  Our labor</p><p>
symbolized nothing, and left us mentally sluggish in the dusk of the</p><p>
evening. Intellectual activity is incompatible with any large amount of</p><p>
bodily exercise.  The yeoman and the scholar--the yeoman and the man of</p><p>
finest moral culture, though not the man of sturdiest sense and</p><p>
integrity--are two distinct individuals, and can never be melted or</p><p>
welded into one substance.</p>
<p>
Zenobia soon saw this truth, and gibed me about it, one evening, as</p><p>
Hollingsworth and I lay on the grass, after a hard day's work.</p>
<p>
"I am afraid you did not make a song today, while loading the</p><p>
hay-cart," said she, "as Burns did, when he was reaping barley."</p>
<p>
"Burns never made a song in haying-time," I answered very positively.</p><p>
"He was no poet while a farmer, and no farmer while a poet."</p>
<p>
"And on the whole, which of the two characters do you like best?" asked</p><p>
Zenobia.  "For I have an idea that you cannot combine them any better</p><p>
than Burns did.  Ah, I see, in my mind's eye, what sort of an</p><p>
individual you are to be, two or three years hence.  Grim Silas Foster</p><p>
is your prototype, with his palm of sole-leather, and his joints of</p><p>
rusty iron (which all through summer keep the stiffness of what he</p><p>
calls his winter's rheumatize), and his brain of--I don't know what his</p><p>
brain is made of, unless it be a Savoy cabbage; but yours may be</p><p>
cauliflower, as a rather more delicate variety.  Your physical man will</p><p>
be transmuted into salt beef and fried pork, at the rate, I should</p><p>
imagine, of a pound and a half a day; that being about the average</p><p>
which we find necessary in the kitchen.  You will make your toilet for</p><p>
the day (still like this delightful Silas Foster) by rinsing your</p><p>
fingers and the front part of your face in a little tin pan of water at</p><p>
the doorstep, and teasing your hair with a wooden pocket-comb before a</p><p>
seven-by-nine-inch looking-glass.  Your only pastime will be to smoke</p><p>
some very vile tobacco in the black stump of a pipe."</p>
<p>
"Pray, spare me!" cried I. "But the pipe is not Silas's only mode of</p><p>
solacing himself with the weed."</p>
<p>
"Your literature," continued Zenobia, apparently delighted with her</p><p>
description, "will be the 'Farmer's Almanac;' for I observe our friend</p><p>
Foster never gets so far as the newspaper.  When you happen to sit</p><p>
down, at odd moments, you will fall asleep, and make nasal proclamation</p><p>
of the fact, as he does; and invariably you must be jogged out of a</p><p>
nap, after supper, by the future Mrs. Coverdale, and persuaded to go</p><p>
regularly to bed.  And on Sundays, when you put on a blue coat with</p><p>
brass buttons, you will think of nothing else to do but to go and</p><p>
lounge over the stone walls and rail fences, and stare at the corn</p><p>
growing.  And you will look with a knowing eye at oxen, and will have a</p><p>
tendency to clamber over into pigsties, and feel of the hogs, and give</p><p>
a guess how much they will weigh after you shall have stuck and dressed</p><p>
them.  Already I have noticed you begin to speak through your nose, and</p><p>
with a drawl.  Pray, if you really did make any poetry to-day, let us</p><p>
hear it in that kind of utterance!"</p>
<p>
"Coverdale has given up making verses now," said Hollingsworth, who</p><p>
never had the slightest appreciation of my poetry.  "Just think of him</p><p>
penning a sonnet with a fist like that!  There is at least this good in</p><p>
a life of toil, that it takes the nonsense and fancy-work out of a man,</p><p>
and leaves nothing but what truly belongs to him.  If a farmer can make</p><p>
poetry at the plough-tail, it must be because his nature insists on it;</p><p>
and if that be the case, let him make it, in Heaven's name!"</p>
<p>
"And how is it with you?" asked Zenobia, in a different voice; for she</p><p>
never laughed at Hollingsworth, as she often did at me.  "You, I think,</p><p>
cannot have ceased to live a life of thought and feeling."</p>
<p>
"I have always been in earnest," answered Hollingsworth.  "I have</p><p>
hammered thought out of iron, after heating the iron in my heart!  It</p><p>
matters little what my outward toil may be.  Were I a slave, at the</p><p>
bottom of a mine, I should keep the same purpose, the same faith in its</p><p>
ultimate accomplishment, that I do now.  Miles Coverdale is not in</p><p>
earnest, either as a poet or a laborer."</p>
<p>
"You give me hard measure, Hollingsworth," said I, a little hurt.  "I</p><p>
have kept pace with you in the field; and my bones feel as if I had</p><p>
been in earnest, whatever may be the case with my brain!"</p>
<p>
"I cannot conceive," observed Zenobia with great emphasis,--and, no</p><p>
doubt, she spoke fairly the feeling of the moment,--"I cannot conceive</p><p>
of being so continually as Mr. Coverdale is within the sphere of a</p><p>
strong and noble nature, without being strengthened and ennobled by its</p><p>
influence!"</p>
<p>
This amiable remark of the fair Zenobia confirmed me in what I had</p><p>
already begun to suspect, that Hollingsworth, like many other</p><p>
illustrious prophets, reformers, and philanthropists, was likely to</p><p>
make at least two proselytes among the women to one among the men.</p><p>
Zenobia and Priscilla!  These, I believe (unless my unworthy self might</p><p>
be reckoned for a third), were the only disciples of his mission; and I</p><p>
spent a great deal of time, uselessly, in trying to conjecture what</p><p>
Hollingsworth meant to do with them--and they with him!</p>
<p>
IX. HOLLINGSWORTH, ZENOBIA, PRISCILLA</p>
<p>
It is not, I apprehend, a healthy kind of mental occupation to devote</p><p>
ourselves too exclusively to the study of individual men and women. If</p><p>
the person under examination be one's self, the result is pretty</p><p>
certain to be diseased action of the heart, almost before we can snatch</p><p>
a second glance.  Or if we take the freedom to put a friend under our</p><p>
microscope, we thereby insulate him from many of his true relations,</p><p>
magnify his peculiarities, inevitably tear him into parts, and of</p><p>
course patch him very clumsily together again.  What wonder, then,</p><p>
should we be frightened by the aspect of a monster, which, after</p><p>
all,--though we can point to every feature of his deformity in the real</p><p>
personage,--may be said to have been created mainly by ourselves.</p>
<p>
Thus, as my conscience has often whispered me, I did Hollingsworth a</p><p>
great wrong by prying into his character; and am perhaps doing him as</p><p>
great a one, at this moment, by putting faith in the discoveries which</p><p>
I seemed to make.  But I could not help it.  Had I loved him less, I</p><p>
might have used him better.  He and Zenobia and Priscilla--both for</p><p>
their own sakes and as connected with him--were separated from the rest</p><p>
of the Community, to my imagination, and stood forth as the indices of</p><p>
a problem which it was my business to solve.  Other associates had a</p><p>
portion of my time; other matters amused me; passing occurrences</p><p>
carried me along with them, while they lasted.  But here was the vortex</p><p>
of my meditations, around which they revolved, and whitherward they too</p><p>
continually tended.  In the midst of cheerful society, I had often a</p><p>
feeling of loneliness.  For it was impossible not to be sensible that,</p><p>
while these three characters figured so largely on my private theatre,</p><p>
I--though probably reckoned as a friend by all--was at best but a</p><p>
secondary or tertiary personage with either of them.</p>
<p>
I loved Hollingsworth, as has already been enough expressed.  But it</p><p>
impressed me, more and more, that there was a stern and dreadful</p><p>
peculiarity in this man, such as could not prove otherwise than</p><p>
pernicious to the happiness of those who should be drawn into too</p><p>
intimate a connection with him.  He was not altogether human.  There</p><p>
was something else in Hollingsworth besides flesh and blood, and</p><p>
sympathies and affections and celestial spirit.</p>
<p>
This is always true of those men who have surrendered themselves to an</p><p>
overruling purpose.  It does not so much impel them from without, nor</p><p>
even operate as a motive power within, but grows incorporate with all</p><p>
that they think and feel, and finally converts them into little else</p><p>
save that one principle.  When such begins to be the predicament, it is</p><p>
not cowardice, but wisdom, to avoid these victims.  They have no heart,</p><p>
no sympathy, no reason, no conscience.  They will keep no friend,</p><p>
unless he make himself the mirror of their purpose; they will smite and</p><p>
slay you, and trample your dead corpse under foot, all the more</p><p>
readily, if you take the first step with them, and cannot take the</p><p>
second, and the third, and every other step of their terribly strait</p><p>
path.  They have an idol to which they consecrate themselves</p><p>
high-priest, and deem it holy work to offer sacrifices of whatever is</p><p>
most precious; and never once seem to suspect--so cunning has the Devil</p><p>
been with them--that this false deity, in whose iron features,</p><p>
immitigable to all the rest of mankind, they see only benignity and</p><p>
love, is but a spectrum of the very priest himself, projected upon the</p><p>
surrounding darkness.  And the higher and purer the original object,</p><p>
and the more unselfishly it may have been taken up, the slighter is the</p><p>
probability that they can be led to recognize the process by which</p><p>
godlike benevolence has been debased into all-devouring egotism.</p>
<p>
Of course I am perfectly aware that the above statement is exaggerated,</p><p>
in the attempt to make it adequate.  Professed philanthropists have</p><p>
gone far; but no originally good man, I presume, ever went quite so far</p><p>
as this.  Let the reader abate whatever he deems fit.  The paragraph</p><p>
may remain, however, both for its truth and its exaggeration, as</p><p>
strongly expressive of the tendencies which were really operative in</p><p>
Hollingsworth, and as exemplifying the kind of error into which my mode</p><p>
of observation was calculated to lead me. The issue was, that in</p><p>
solitude I often shuddered at my friend.  In my recollection of his</p><p>
dark and impressive countenance, the features grew more sternly</p><p>
prominent than the reality, duskier in their depth and shadow, and more</p><p>
lurid in their light; the frown, that had merely flitted across his</p><p>
brow, seemed to have contorted it with an adamantine wrinkle.  On</p><p>
meeting him again, I was often filled with remorse, when his deep eyes</p><p>
beamed kindly upon me, as with the glow of a household fire that was</p><p>
burning in a cave.  "He is a man after all," thought I; "his Maker's</p><p>
own truest image, a philanthropic man!--not that steel engine of the</p><p>
Devil's contrivance, a philanthropist!" But in my wood-walks, and in my</p><p>
silent chamber, the dark face frowned at me again.</p>
<p>
When a young girl comes within the sphere of such a man, she is as</p><p>
perilously situated as the maiden whom, in the old classical myths, the</p><p>
people used to expose to a dragon.  If I had any duty whatever, in</p><p>
reference to Hollingsworth, it was to endeavor to save Priscilla from</p><p>
that kind of personal worship which her sex is generally prone to</p><p>
lavish upon saints and heroes.  It often requires but one smile out of</p><p>
the hero's eyes into the girl's or woman's heart, to transform this</p><p>
devotion, from a sentiment of the highest approval and confidence, into</p><p>
passionate love.  Now, Hollingsworth smiled much upon Priscilla,--more</p><p>
than upon any other person.  If she thought him beautiful, it was no</p><p>
wonder.  I often thought him so, with the expression of tender human</p><p>
care and gentlest sympathy which she alone seemed to have power to call</p><p>
out upon his features.  Zenobia, I suspect, would have given her eyes,</p><p>
bright as they were, for such a look; it was the least that our poor</p><p>
Priscilla could do, to give her heart for a great many of them.  There</p><p>
was the more danger of this, inasmuch as the footing on which we all</p><p>
associated at Blithedale was widely different from that of conventional</p><p>
society.  While inclining us to the soft affections of the golden age,</p><p>
it seemed to authorize any individual, of either sex, to fall in love</p><p>
with any other, regardless of what would elsewhere be judged suitable</p><p>
and prudent. Accordingly the tender passion was very rife among us, in</p><p>
various degrees of mildness or virulence, but mostly passing away with</p><p>
the state of things that had given it origin.  This was all well</p><p>
enough; but, for a girl like Priscilla and a woman like Zenobia to</p><p>
jostle one another in their love of a man like Hollingsworth, was</p><p>
likely to be no child's play.</p>
<p>
Had I been as cold-hearted as I sometimes thought myself, nothing would</p><p>
have interested me more than to witness the play of passions that must</p><p>
thus have been evolved.  But, in honest truth, I would really have gone</p><p>
far to save Priscilla, at least, from the catastrophe in which such a</p><p>
drama would be apt to terminate.</p>
<p>
Priscilla had now grown to be a very pretty girl, and still kept</p><p>
budding and blossoming, and daily putting on some new charm, which you</p><p>
no sooner became sensible of than you thought it worth all that she had</p><p>
previously possessed.  So unformed, vague, and without substance, as</p><p>
she had come to us, it seemed as if we could see Nature shaping out a</p><p>
woman before our very eyes, and yet had only a more reverential sense</p><p>
of the mystery of a woman's soul and frame. Yesterday, her cheek was</p><p>
pale, to-day, it had a bloom.  Priscilla's smile, like a baby's first</p><p>
one, was a wondrous novelty.  Her imperfections and shortcomings</p><p>
affected me with a kind of playful pathos, which was as absolutely</p><p>
bewitching a sensation as ever I experienced.  After she had been a</p><p>
month or two at Blithedale, her animal spirits waxed high, and kept her</p><p>
pretty constantly in a state of bubble and ferment, impelling her to</p><p>
far more bodily activity than she had yet strength to endure.  She was</p><p>
very fond of playing with the other girls out of doors.  There is</p><p>
hardly another sight in the world so pretty as that of a company of</p><p>
young girls, almost women grown, at play, and so giving themselves up</p><p>
to their airy impulse that their tiptoes barely touch the ground.</p>
<p>
Girls are incomparably wilder and more effervescent than boys, more</p><p>
untamable and regardless of rule and limit, with an ever-shifting</p><p>
variety, breaking continually into new modes of fun, yet with a</p><p>
harmonious propriety through all.  Their steps, their voices, appear</p><p>
free as the wind, but keep consonance with a strain of music inaudible</p><p>
to us.  Young men and boys, on the other hand, play, according to</p><p>
recognized law, old, traditionary games, permitting no caprioles of</p><p>
fancy, but with scope enough for the outbreak of savage instincts.</p><p>
For, young or old, in play or in earnest, man is prone to be a brute.</p>
<p>
Especially is it delightful to see a vigorous young girl run a race,</p><p>
with her head thrown back, her limbs moving more friskily than they</p><p>
need, and an air between that of a bird and a young colt.  But</p><p>
Priscilla's peculiar charm, in a foot-race, was the weakness and</p><p>
irregularity with which she ran.  Growing up without exercise, except</p><p>
to her poor little fingers, she had never yet acquired the perfect use</p><p>
of her legs.  Setting buoyantly forth, therefore, as if no rival less</p><p>
swift than Atalanta could compete with her, she ran falteringly, and</p><p>
often tumbled on the grass.  Such an incident--though it seems too</p><p>
slight to think of--was a thing to laugh at, but which brought the</p><p>
water into one's eyes, and lingered in the memory after far greater</p><p>
joys and sorrows were wept out of it, as antiquated trash. Priscilla's</p><p>
life, as I beheld it, was full of trifles that affected me in just this</p><p>
way.</p>
<p>
When she had come to be quite at home among us, I used to fancy that</p><p>
Priscilla played more pranks, and perpetrated more mischief, than any</p><p>
other girl in the Community.  For example, I once heard Silas Foster,</p><p>
in a very gruff voice, threatening to rivet three horseshoes round</p><p>
Priscilla's neck and chain her to a post, because she, with some other</p><p>
young people, had clambered upon a load of hay, and caused it to slide</p><p>
off the cart.  How she made her peace I never knew; but very soon</p><p>
afterwards I saw old Silas, with his brawny hands round Priscilla's</p><p>
waist, swinging her to and fro, and finally depositing her on one of</p><p>
the oxen, to take her first lessons in riding.  She met with terrible</p><p>
mishaps in her efforts to milk a cow; she let the poultry into the</p><p>
garden; she generally spoilt whatever part of the dinner she took in</p><p>
charge; she broke crockery; she dropt our biggest water pitcher into</p><p>
the well; and--except with her needle, and those little wooden</p><p>
instruments for purse-making--was as unserviceable a member of society</p><p>
as any young lady in the land.  There was no other sort of efficiency</p><p>
about her.  Yet everybody was kind to Priscilla; everybody loved her</p><p>
and laughed at her to her face, and did not laugh behind her back;</p><p>
everybody would have given her half of his last crust, or the bigger</p><p>
share of his plum-cake.  These were pretty certain indications that we</p><p>
were all conscious of a pleasant weakness in the girl, and considered</p><p>
her not quite able to look after her own interests or fight her battle</p><p>
with the world.  And Hollingsworth--perhaps because he had been the</p><p>
means of introducing Priscilla to her new abode--appeared to recognize</p><p>
her as his own especial charge.</p>
<p>
Her simple, careless, childish flow of spirits often made me sad. She</p><p>
seemed to me like a butterfly at play in a flickering bit of sunshine,</p><p>
and mistaking it for a broad and eternal summer.  We sometimes hold</p><p>
mirth to a stricter accountability than sorrow; it must show good</p><p>
cause, or the echo of its laughter comes back drearily. Priscilla's</p><p>
gayety, moreover, was of a nature that showed me how delicate an</p><p>
instrument she was, and what fragile harp-strings were her nerves.  As</p><p>
they made sweet music at the airiest touch, it would require but a</p><p>
stronger one to burst them all asunder.  Absurd as it might be, I tried</p><p>
to reason with her, and persuade her not to be so joyous, thinking</p><p>
that, if she would draw less lavishly upon her fund of happiness, it</p><p>
would last the longer.  I remember doing so, one summer evening, when</p><p>
we tired laborers sat looking on, like Goldsmith's old folks under the</p><p>
village thorn-tree, while the young people were at their sports.</p>
<p>
"What is the use or sense of being so very gay?"  I said to Priscilla,</p><p>
while she was taking breath, after a great frolic.  "I love to see a</p><p>
sufficient cause for everything, and I can see none for this.  Pray</p><p>
tell me, now, what kind of a world you imagine this to be, which you</p><p>
are so merry in."</p>
<p>
"I never think about it at all," answered Priscilla, laughing.  "But</p><p>
this I am sure of, that it is a world where everybody is kind to me,</p><p>
and where I love everybody.  My heart keeps dancing within me, and all</p><p>
the foolish things which you see me do are only the motions of my</p><p>
heart.  How can I be dismal, if my heart will not let me?"</p>
<p>
"Have you nothing dismal to remember?"  I suggested.  "If not, then,</p><p>
indeed, you are very fortunate!"</p>
<p>
"Ah!" said Priscilla slowly.</p>
<p>
And then came that unintelligible gesture, when she seemed to be</p><p>
listening to a distant voice.</p>
<p>
"For my part," I continued, beneficently seeking to overshadow her with</p><p>
my own sombre humor, "my past life has been a tiresome one enough; yet</p><p>
I would rather look backward ten times than forward once. For, little</p><p>
as we know of our life to come, we may be very sure, for one thing,</p><p>
that the good we aim at will not be attained.  People never do get just</p><p>
the good they seek.  If it come at all, it is something else, which</p><p>
they never dreamed of, and did not particularly want.  Then, again, we</p><p>
may rest certain that our friends of to-day will not be our friends of</p><p>
a few years hence; but, if we keep one of them, it will be at the</p><p>
expense of the others; and most probably we shall keep none.  To be</p><p>
sure, there are more to be had; but who cares about making a new set of</p><p>
friends, even should they be better than those around us?"</p>
<p>
"Not I!" said Priscilla.  "I will live and die with these!"</p>
<p>
"Well; but let the future go," resumed I. "As for the present moment,</p><p>
if we could look into the hearts where we wish to be most valued, what</p><p>
should you expect to see?  One's own likeness, in the innermost,</p><p>
holiest niche?  Ah!  I don't know!  It may not be there at all.  It may</p><p>
be a dusty image, thrust aside into a corner, and by and by to be flung</p><p>
out of doors, where any foot may trample upon it.  If not to-day, then</p><p>
to-morrow!  And so, Priscilla, I do not see much wisdom in being so</p><p>
very merry in this kind of a world."</p>
<p>
It had taken me nearly seven years of worldly life to hive up the</p><p>
bitter honey which I here offered to Priscilla.  And she rejected it!</p>
<p>
"I don't believe one word of what you say!" she replied, laughing anew.</p><p>
"You made me sad, for a minute, by talking about the past; but the past</p><p>
never comes back again.  Do we dream the same dream twice? There is</p><p>
nothing else that I am afraid of."</p>
<p>
So away she ran, and fell down on the green grass, as it was often her</p><p>
luck to do, but got up again, without any harm.</p>
<p>
"Priscilla, Priscilla!" cried Hollingsworth, who was sitting on the</p><p>
doorstep; "you had better not run any more to-night.  You will weary</p><p>
yourself too much.  And do not sit down out of doors, for there is a</p><p>
heavy dew beginning to fall."</p>
<p>
At his first word, she went and sat down under the porch, at</p><p>
Hollingsworth's feet, entirely contented and happy.  What charm was</p><p>
there in his rude massiveness that so attracted and soothed this</p><p>
shadow-like girl?  It appeared to me, who have always been curious in</p><p>
such matters, that Priscilla's vague and seemingly causeless flow of</p><p>
felicitous feeling was that with which love blesses inexperienced</p><p>
hearts, before they begin to suspect what is going on within them. It</p><p>
transports them to the seventh heaven; and if you ask what brought them</p><p>
thither, they neither can tell nor care to learn, but cherish an</p><p>
ecstatic faith that there they shall abide forever.</p>
<p>
Zenobia was in the doorway, not far from Hollingsworth.  She gazed at</p><p>
Priscilla in a very singular way.  Indeed, it was a sight worth gazing</p><p>
at, and a beautiful sight, too, as the fair girl sat at the feet of</p><p>
that dark, powerful figure.  Her air, while perfectly modest, delicate,</p><p>
and virgin-like, denoted her as swayed by Hollingsworth, attracted to</p><p>
him, and unconsciously seeking to rest upon his strength. I could not</p><p>
turn away my own eyes, but hoped that nobody, save Zenobia and myself,</p><p>
was witnessing this picture.  It is before me now, with the evening</p><p>
twilight a little deepened by the dusk of memory.</p>
<p>
"Come hither, Priscilla," said Zenobia.  "I have something to say to</p><p>
you."</p>
<p>
She spoke in little more than a whisper.  But it is strange how</p><p>
expressive of moods a whisper may often be.  Priscilla felt at once</p><p>
that something had gone wrong.</p>
<p>
"Are you angry with me?" she asked, rising slowly, and standing before</p><p>
Zenobia in a drooping attitude.  "What have I done?  I hope you are not</p><p>
angry!"</p>
<p>
"No, no, Priscilla!" said Hollingsworth, smiling.  "I will answer for</p><p>
it, she is not.  You are the one little person in the world with whom</p><p>
nobody can be angry!"</p>
<p>
"Angry with you, child?  What a silly idea!" exclaimed Zenobia,</p><p>
laughing.  "No, indeed!  But, my dear Priscilla, you are getting to be</p><p>
so very pretty that you absolutely need a duenna; and, as I am older</p><p>
than you, and have had my own little experience of life, and think</p><p>
myself exceedingly sage, I intend to fill the place of a maiden aunt.</p><p>
Every day, I shall give you a lecture, a quarter of an hour in length,</p><p>
on the morals, manners, and proprieties of social life.  When our</p><p>
pastoral shall be quite played out, Priscilla, my worldly wisdom may</p><p>
stand you in good stead."</p>
<p>
"I am afraid you are angry with me!" repeated Priscilla sadly; for,</p><p>
while she seemed as impressible as wax, the girl often showed a</p><p>
persistency in her own ideas as stubborn as it was gentle.</p>
<p>
"Dear me, what can I say to the child!" cried Zenobia in a tone of</p><p>
humorous vexation.  "Well, well; since you insist on my being angry,</p><p>
come to my room this moment, and let me beat you!"</p>
<p>
Zenobia bade Hollingsworth good-night very sweetly, and nodded to me</p><p>
with a smile.  But, just as she turned aside with Priscilla into the</p><p>
dimness of the porch, I caught another glance at her countenance.  It</p><p>
would have made the fortune of a tragic actress, could she have</p><p>
borrowed it for the moment when she fumbles in her bosom for the</p><p>
concealed dagger, or the exceedingly sharp bodkin, or mingles the</p><p>
ratsbane in her lover's bowl of wine or her rival's cup of tea.  Not</p><p>
that I in the least anticipated any such catastrophe,--it being a</p><p>
remarkable truth that custom has in no one point a greater sway than</p><p>
over our modes of wreaking our wild passions.  And besides, had we been</p><p>
in Italy, instead of New England, it was hardly yet a crisis for the</p><p>
dagger or the bowl.</p>
<p>
It often amazed me, however, that Hollingsworth should show himself so</p><p>
recklessly tender towards Priscilla, and never once seem to think of</p><p>
the effect which it might have upon her heart.  But the man, as I have</p><p>
endeavored to explain, was thrown completely off his moral balance, and</p><p>
quite bewildered as to his personal relations, by his great excrescence</p><p>
of a philanthropic scheme.  I used to see, or fancy, indications that</p><p>
he was not altogether obtuse to Zenobia's influence as a woman.  No</p><p>
doubt, however, he had a still more exquisite enjoyment of Priscilla's</p><p>
silent sympathy with his purposes, so unalloyed with criticism, and</p><p>
therefore more grateful than any intellectual approbation, which always</p><p>
involves a possible reserve of latent censure.  A man--poet, prophet,</p><p>
or whatever he may be--readily persuades himself of his right to all</p><p>
the worship that is voluntarily tendered.  In requital of so rich</p><p>
benefits as he was to confer upon mankind, it would have been hard to</p><p>
deny Hollingsworth the simple solace of a young girl's heart, which he</p><p>
held in his hand, and smelled too, like a rosebud.  But what if, while</p><p>
pressing out its fragrance, he should crush the tender rosebud in his</p><p>
grasp!</p>
<p>
As for Zenobia, I saw no occasion to give myself any trouble.  With her</p><p>
native strength, and her experience of the world, she could not be</p><p>
supposed to need any help of mine.  Nevertheless, I was really generous</p><p>
enough to feel some little interest likewise for Zenobia. With all her</p><p>
faults (which might have been a great many besides the abundance that I</p><p>
knew of), she possessed noble traits, and a heart which must, at least,</p><p>
have been valuable while new.  And she seemed ready to fling it away as</p><p>
uncalculatingly as Priscilla herself.  I could not but suspect that, if</p><p>
merely at play with Hollingsworth, she was sporting with a power which</p><p>
she did not fully estimate.  Or if in earnest, it might chance, between</p><p>
Zenobia's passionate force and his dark, self-delusive egotism, to turn</p><p>
out such earnest as would develop itself in some sufficiently tragic</p><p>
catastrophe, though the dagger and the bowl should go for nothing in it.</p>
<p>
Meantime, the gossip of the Community set them down as a pair of</p><p>
lovers.  They took walks together, and were not seldom encountered in</p><p>
the wood-paths: Hollingsworth deeply discoursing, in tones solemn and</p><p>
sternly pathetic; Zenobia, with a rich glow on her cheeks, and her eyes</p><p>
softened from their ordinary brightness, looked so beautiful, that had</p><p>
her companion been ten times a philanthropist, it seemed impossible but</p><p>
that one glance should melt him back into a man. Oftener than anywhere</p><p>
else, they went to a certain point on the slope of a pasture,</p><p>
commanding nearly the whole of our own domain, besides a view of the</p><p>
river, and an airy prospect of many distant hills.  The bond of our</p><p>
Community was such, that the members had the privilege of building</p><p>
cottages for their own residence within our precincts, thus laying a</p><p>
hearthstone and fencing in a home private and peculiar to all desirable</p><p>
extent, while yet the inhabitants should continue to share the</p><p>
advantages of an associated life.  It was inferred that Hollingsworth</p><p>
and Zenobia intended to rear their dwelling on this favorite spot.</p>
<p>
I mentioned those rumors to Hollingsworth in a playful way.</p>
<p>
"Had you consulted me," I went on to observe, "I should have</p><p>
recommended a site farther to the left, just a little withdrawn into</p><p>
the wood, with two or three peeps at the prospect among the trees. You</p><p>
will be in the shady vale of years long before you can raise any better</p><p>
kind of shade around your cottage, if you build it on this bare slope."</p>
<p>
"But I offer my edifice as a spectacle to the world," said</p><p>
Hollingsworth, "that it may take example and build many another like</p><p>
it.  Therefore, I mean to set it on the open hillside."</p>
<p>
Twist these words how I might, they offered no very satisfactory</p><p>
import.  It seemed hardly probable that Hollingsworth should care about</p><p>
educating the public taste in the department of cottage architecture,</p><p>
desirable as such improvement certainly was.</p>
<p>
X. A VISITOR FROM TOWN</p>
<p>
Hollingsworth and I--we had been hoeing potatoes, that forenoon, while</p><p>
the rest of the fraternity were engaged in a distant quarter of the</p><p>
farm--sat under a clump of maples, eating our eleven o'clock lunch,</p><p>
when we saw a stranger approaching along the edge of the field. He had</p><p>
admitted himself from the roadside through a turnstile, and seemed to</p><p>
have a purpose of speaking with us.</p>
<p>
And, by the bye, we were favored with many visits at Blithedale,</p><p>
especially from people who sympathized with our theories, and perhaps</p><p>
held themselves ready to unite in our actual experiment as soon as</p><p>
there should appear a reliable promise of its success.  It was rather</p><p>
ludicrous, indeed (to me, at least, whose enthusiasm had insensibly</p><p>
been exhaled together with the perspiration of many a hard day's toil),</p><p>
it was absolutely funny, therefore, to observe what a glory was shed</p><p>
about our life and labors, in the imaginations of these longing</p><p>
proselytes.  In their view, we were as poetical as Arcadians, besides</p><p>
being as practical as the hardest-fisted husbandmen in Massachusetts.</p><p>
We did not, it is true, spend much time in piping to our sheep, or</p><p>
warbling our innocent loves to the sisterhood.  But they gave us credit</p><p>
for imbuing the ordinary rustic occupations with a kind of religious</p><p>
poetry, insomuch that our very cow-yards and pig-sties were as</p><p>
delightfully fragrant as a flower garden.  Nothing used to please me</p><p>
more than to see one of these lay enthusiasts snatch up a hoe, as they</p><p>
were very prone to do, and set to work with a vigor that perhaps</p><p>
carried him through about a dozen ill-directed strokes.  Men are</p><p>
wonderfully soon satisfied, in this day of shameful bodily enervation,</p><p>
when, from one end of life to the other, such multitudes never taste</p><p>
the sweet weariness that follows accustomed toil.  I seldom saw the new</p><p>
enthusiasm that did not grow as flimsy and flaccid as the proselyte's</p><p>
moistened shirt-collar, with a quarter of an hour's active labor under</p><p>
a July sun.</p>
<p>
But the person now at hand had not at all the air of one of these</p><p>
amiable visionaries.  He was an elderly man, dressed rather shabbily,</p><p>
yet decently enough, in a gray frock-coat, faded towards a brown hue,</p><p>
and wore a broad-brimmed white hat, of the fashion of several years</p><p>
gone by.  His hair was perfect silver, without a dark thread in the</p><p>
whole of it; his nose, though it had a scarlet tip, by no means</p><p>
indicated the jollity of which a red nose is the generally admitted</p><p>
symbol.  He was a subdued, undemonstrative old man, who would doubtless</p><p>
drink a glass of liquor, now and then, and probably more than was good</p><p>
for him,--not, however, with a purpose of undue exhilaration, but in</p><p>
the hope of bringing his spirits up to the ordinary level of the</p><p>
world's cheerfulness.  Drawing nearer, there was a shy look about him,</p><p>
as if he were ashamed of his poverty, or, at any rate, for some reason</p><p>
or other, would rather have us glance at him sidelong than take a full</p><p>
front view.  He had a queer appearance of hiding himself behind the</p><p>
patch on his left eye.</p>
<p>
"I know this old gentleman," said I to Hollingsworth, as we sat</p><p>
observing him; "that is, I have met him a hundred times in town, and</p><p>
have often amused my fancy with wondering what he was before he came to</p><p>
be what he is.  He haunts restaurants and such places, and has an odd</p><p>
way of lurking in corners or getting behind a door whenever</p><p>
practicable, and holding out his hand with some little article in it</p><p>
which he wishes you to buy.  The eye of the world seems to trouble him,</p><p>
although he necessarily lives so much in it.  I never expected to see</p><p>
him in an open field."</p>
<p>
"Have you learned anything of his history?" asked Hollingsworth.</p>
<p>
"Not a circumstance," I answered; "but there must be something curious</p><p>
in it.  I take him to be a harmless sort of a person, and a tolerably</p><p>
honest one; but his manners, being so furtive, remind me of those of a</p><p>
rat,--a rat without the mischief, the fierce eye, the teeth to bite</p><p>
with, or the desire to bite.  See, now!  He means to skulk along that</p><p>
fringe of bushes, and approach us on the other side of our clump of</p><p>
maples."</p>
<p>
We soon heard the old man's velvet tread on the grass, indicating that</p><p>
he had arrived within a few feet of where we Sat.</p>
<p>
"Good-morning, Mr. Moodie," said Hollingsworth, addressing the stranger</p><p>
as an acquaintance; "you must have had a hot and tiresome walk from the</p><p>
city.  Sit down, and take a morsel of our bread and cheese."</p>
<p>
The visitor made a grateful little murmur of acquiescence, and sat down</p><p>
in a spot somewhat removed; so that, glancing round, I could see his</p><p>
gray pantaloons and dusty shoes, while his upper part was mostly hidden</p><p>
behind the shrubbery.  Nor did he come forth from this retirement</p><p>
during the whole of the interview that followed.  We handed him such</p><p>
food as we had, together with a brown jug of molasses and water (would</p><p>
that it had been brandy, or some thing better, for the sake of his</p><p>
chill old heart!), like priests offering dainty sacrifice to an</p><p>
enshrined and invisible idol.  I have no idea that he really lacked</p><p>
sustenance; but it was quite touching, nevertheless, to hear him</p><p>
nibbling away at our crusts.</p>
<p>
"Mr. Moodie," said I, "do you remember selling me one of those very</p><p>
pretty little silk purses, of which you seem to have a monopoly in the</p><p>
market?  I keep it to this day, I can assure you."</p>
<p>
"Ah, thank you," said our guest.  "Yes, Mr. Coverdale, I used to sell a</p><p>
good many of those little purses."</p>
<p>
He spoke languidly, and only those few words, like a watch with an</p><p>
inelastic spring, that just ticks a moment or two and stops again. He</p><p>
seemed a very forlorn old man.  In the wantonness of youth, strength,</p><p>
and comfortable condition,--making my prey of people's individualities,</p><p>
as my custom was,--I tried to identify my mind with the old fellow's,</p><p>
and take his view of the world, as if looking through a smoke-blackened</p><p>
glass at the sun.  It robbed the landscape of all its life.  Those</p><p>
pleasantly swelling slopes of our farm, descending towards the wide</p><p>
meadows, through which sluggishly circled the brimful tide of the</p><p>
Charles, bathing the long sedges on its hither and farther shores; the</p><p>
broad, sunny gleam over the winding water; that peculiar</p><p>
picturesqueness of the scene where capes and headlands put themselves</p><p>
boldly forth upon the perfect level of the meadow, as into a green</p><p>
lake, with inlets between the promontories; the shadowy woodland, with</p><p>
twinkling showers of light falling into its depths; the sultry</p><p>
heat-vapor, which rose everywhere like incense, and in which my soul</p><p>
delighted, as indicating so rich a fervor in the passionate day, and in</p><p>
the earth that was burning with its love,--I beheld all these things as</p><p>
through old Moodie's eyes.  When my eyes are dimmer than they have yet</p><p>
come to be, I will go thither again, and see if I did not catch the</p><p>
tone of his mind aright, and if the cold and lifeless tint of his</p><p>
perceptions be not then repeated in my own.</p>
<p>
Yet it was unaccountable to myself, the interest that I felt in him.</p>
<p>
"Have you any objection," said I, "to telling me who made those little</p><p>
purses?"</p>
<p>
"Gentlemen have often asked me that," said Moodie slowly; "but I shake</p><p>
my head, and say little or nothing, and creep out of the way as well as</p><p>
I can.  I am a man of few words; and if gentlemen were to be told one</p><p>
thing, they would be very apt, I suppose, to ask me another. But it</p><p>
happens just now, Mr. Coverdale, that you can tell me more about the</p><p>
maker of those little purses than I can tell you."</p>
<p>
"Why do you trouble him with needless questions, Coverdale?"</p><p>
interrupted Hollingsworth.  "You must have known, long ago, that it was</p><p>
Priscilla.  And so, my good friend, you have come to see her? Well, I</p><p>
am glad of it.  You will find her altered very much for the better,</p><p>
since that winter evening when you put her into my charge. Why,</p><p>
Priscilla has a bloom in her cheeks, now!"</p>
<p>
"Has my pale little girl a bloom?" repeated Moodie with a kind of slow</p><p>
wonder.  "Priscilla with a bloom in her cheeks!  Ah, I am afraid I</p><p>
shall not know my little girl.  And is she happy?"</p>
<p>
"Just as happy as a bird," answered Hollingsworth.</p>
<p>
"Then, gentlemen," said our guest apprehensively, "I don't think it</p><p>
well for me to go any farther.  I crept hitherward only to ask about</p><p>
Priscilla; and now that you have told me such good news, perhaps I can</p><p>
do no better than to creep back again.  If she were to see this old</p><p>
face of mine, the child would remember some very sad times which we</p><p>
have spent together.  Some very sad times, indeed!  She has forgotten</p><p>
them, I know,--them and me,--else she could not be so happy, nor have a</p><p>
bloom in her cheeks.  Yes--yes--yes," continued he, still with the same</p><p>
torpid utterance; "with many thanks to you, Mr. Hollingsworth, I will</p><p>
creep back to town again."</p>
<p>
"You shall do no such thing, Mr. Moodie," said Hollingsworth bluffly.</p><p>
"Priscilla often speaks of you; and if there lacks anything to make her</p><p>
cheeks bloom like two damask roses, I'll venture to say it is just the</p><p>
sight of your face.  Come,--we will go and find her."</p>
<p>
"Mr. Hollingsworth!" said the old man in his hesitating way.</p>
<p>
"Well," answered Hollingsworth.</p>
<p>
"Has there been any call for Priscilla?" asked Moodie; and though his</p><p>
face was hidden from us, his tone gave a sure indication of the</p><p>
mysterious nod and wink with which he put the question.  "You know, I</p><p>
think, sir, what I mean."</p>
<p>
"I have not the remotest suspicion what you mean, Mr. Moodie," replied</p><p>
Hollingsworth; "nobody, to my knowledge, has called for Priscilla,</p><p>
except yourself.  But come; we are losing time, and I have several</p><p>
things to say to you by the way."</p>
<p>
"And, Mr. Hollingsworth!" repeated Moodie.</p>
<p>
"Well, again!" cried my friend rather impatiently.  "What now?"</p>
<p>
"There is a lady here," said the old man; and his voice lost some of</p><p>
its wearisome hesitation.  "You will account it a very strange matter</p><p>
for me to talk about; but I chanced to know this lady when she was but</p><p>
a little child.  If I am rightly informed, she has grown to be a very</p><p>
fine woman, and makes a brilliant figure in the world, with her beauty,</p><p>
and her talents, and her noble way of spending her riches.  I should</p><p>
recognize this lady, so people tell me, by a magnificent flower in her</p><p>
hair."</p>
<p>
"What a rich tinge it gives to his colorless ideas, when he speaks of</p><p>
Zenobia!"  I whispered to Hollingsworth.  "But how can there possibly</p><p>
be any interest or connecting link between him and her?"</p>
<p>
"The old man, for years past," whispered Hollingsworth, "has been a</p><p>
little out of his right mind, as you probably see."</p>
<p>
"What I would inquire," resumed Moodie, "is whether this beautiful lady</p><p>
is kind to my poor Priscilla."</p>
<p>
"Very kind," said Hollingsworth.</p>
<p>
"Does she love her?" asked Moodie.</p>
<p>
"It should seem so," answered my friend.  "They are always together."</p>
<p>
"Like a gentlewoman and her maid-servant, I fancy?" suggested the old</p><p>
man.</p>
<p>
There was something so singular in his way of saying this, that I could</p><p>
not resist the impulse to turn quite round, so as to catch a glimpse of</p><p>
his face, almost imagining that I should see another person than old</p><p>
Moodie.  But there he sat, with the patched side of his face towards me.</p>
<p>
"Like an elder and younger sister, rather," replied Hollingsworth.</p>
<p>
"Ah!" said Moodie more complacently, for his latter tones had harshness</p><p>
and acidity in them,--"it would gladden my old heart to witness that.</p><p>
If one thing would make me happier than another, Mr. Hollingsworth, it</p><p>
would be to see that beautiful lady holding my little girl by the hand."</p>
<p>
"Come along," said Hollingsworth, "and perhaps you may."</p>
<p>
After a little more delay on the part of our freakish visitor, they set</p><p>
forth together, old Moodie keeping a step or two behind Hollingsworth,</p><p>
so that the latter could not very conveniently look him in the face.  I</p><p>
remained under the tuft of maples, doing my utmost to draw an inference</p><p>
from the scene that had just passed.  In spite of Hollingsworth's</p><p>
off-hand explanation, it did not strike me that our strange guest was</p><p>
really beside himself, but only that his mind needed screwing up, like</p><p>
an instrument long out of tune, the strings of which have ceased to</p><p>
vibrate smartly and sharply. Methought it would be profitable for us,</p><p>
projectors of a happy life, to welcome this old gray shadow, and</p><p>
cherish him as one of us, and let him creep about our domain, in order</p><p>
that he might be a little merrier for our sakes, and we, sometimes, a</p><p>
little sadder for his. Human destinies look ominous without some</p><p>
perceptible intermixture of the sable or the gray.  And then, too,</p><p>
should any of our fraternity grow feverish with an over-exulting sense</p><p>
of prosperity, it would be a sort of cooling regimen to slink off into</p><p>
the woods, and spend an hour, or a day, or as many days as might be</p><p>
requisite to the cure, in uninterrupted communion with this deplorable</p><p>
old Moodie!</p>
<p>
Going homeward to dinner, I had a glimpse of him, behind the trunk of a</p><p>
tree, gazing earnestly towards a particular window of the farmhouse;</p><p>
and by and by Priscilla appeared at this window, playfully drawing</p><p>
along Zenobia, who looked as bright as the very day that was blazing</p><p>
down upon us, only not, by many degrees, so well advanced towards her</p><p>
noon.  I was convinced that this pretty sight must have been purposely</p><p>
arranged by Priscilla for the old man to see.  But either the girl held</p><p>
her too long, or her fondness was resented as too great a freedom; for</p><p>
Zenobia suddenly put Priscilla decidedly away, and gave her a haughty</p><p>
look, as from a mistress to a dependant.  Old Moodie shook his head;</p><p>
and again and again I saw him shake it, as he withdrew along the road;</p><p>
and at the last point whence the farmhouse was visible, he turned and</p><p>
shook his uplifted staff.</p>
<p>
XI. THE WOOD-PATH</p>
<p>
Not long after the preceding incident, in order to get the ache of too</p><p>
constant labor out of my bones, and to relieve my spirit of the</p><p>
irksomeness of a settled routine, I took a holiday.  It was my purpose</p><p>
to spend it all alone, from breakfast-time till twilight, in the</p><p>
deepest wood-seclusion that lay anywhere around us.  Though fond of</p><p>
society, I was so constituted as to need these occasional retirements,</p><p>
even in a life like that of Blithedale, which was itself characterized</p><p>
by a remoteness from the world.  Unless renewed by a yet further</p><p>
withdrawal towards the inner circle of self-communion, I lost the</p><p>
better part of my individuality.  My thoughts became of little worth,</p><p>
and my sensibilities grew as arid as a tuft of moss (a thing whose life</p><p>
is in the shade, the rain, or the noontide dew), crumbling in the</p><p>
sunshine after long expectance of a shower.  So, with my heart full of</p><p>
a drowsy pleasure, and cautious not to dissipate my mood by previous</p><p>
intercourse with any one, I hurried away, and was soon pacing a</p><p>
wood-path, arched overhead with boughs, and dusky-brown beneath my feet.</p>
<p>
At first I walked very swiftly, as if the heavy flood tide of social</p><p>
life were roaring at my heels, and would outstrip and overwhelm me,</p><p>
without all the better diligence in my escape.  But, threading the more</p><p>
distant windings of the track, I abated my pace, and looked about me</p><p>
for some side-aisle, that should admit me into the innermost sanctuary</p><p>
of this green cathedral, just as, in human acquaintanceship, a casual</p><p>
opening sometimes lets us, all of a sudden, into the long-sought</p><p>
intimacy of a mysterious heart.  So much was I absorbed in my</p><p>
reflections,--or, rather, in my mood, the substance of which was as yet</p><p>
too shapeless to be called thought,--that footsteps rustled on the</p><p>
leaves, and a figure passed me by, almost without impressing either the</p><p>
sound or sight upon my consciousness.</p>
<p>
A moment afterwards, I heard a voice at a little distance behind me,</p><p>
speaking so sharply and impertinently that it made a complete discord</p><p>
with my spiritual state, and caused the latter to vanish as abruptly as</p><p>
when you thrust a finger into a soap-bubble.</p>
<p>
"Halloo, friend!" cried this most unseasonable voice.  "Stop a moment,</p><p>
I say!  I must have a word with you!"</p>
<p>
I turned about, in a humor ludicrously irate.  In the first place, the</p><p>
interruption, at any rate, was a grievous injury; then, the tone</p><p>
displeased me.  And finally, unless there be real affection in his</p><p>
heart, a man cannot,--such is the bad state to which the world has</p><p>
brought itself,--cannot more effectually show his contempt for a</p><p>
brother mortal, nor more gallingly assume a position of superiority,</p><p>
than by addressing him as "friend."  Especially does the misapplication</p><p>
of this phrase bring out that latent hostility which is sure to animate</p><p>
peculiar sects, and those who, with however generous a purpose, have</p><p>
sequestered themselves from the crowd; a feeling, it is true, which may</p><p>
be hidden in some dog-kennel of the heart, grumbling there in the</p><p>
darkness, but is never quite extinct, until the dissenting party have</p><p>
gained power and scope enough to treat the world generously.  For my</p><p>
part, I should have taken it as far less an insult to be styled</p><p>
"fellow," "clown," or "bumpkin."  To either of these appellations my</p><p>
rustic garb (it was a linen blouse, with checked shirt and striped</p><p>
pantaloons, a chip hat on my head, and a rough hickory stick in my</p><p>
hand) very fairly entitled me.  As the case stood, my temper darted at</p><p>
once to the opposite pole; not friend, but enemy!</p>
<p>
"What do you want with me?" said I, facing about.</p>
<p>
"Come a little nearer, friend," said the stranger, beckoning.</p>
<p>
"No," answered I. "If I can do anything for you without too much</p><p>
trouble to myself, say so.  But recollect, if you please, that you are</p><p>
not speaking to an acquaintance, much less a friend!"</p>
<p>
"Upon my word, I believe not!" retorted he, looking at me with some</p><p>
curiosity; and, lifting his hat, he made me a salute which had enough</p><p>
of sarcasm to be offensive, and just enough of doubtful courtesy to</p><p>
render any resentment of it absurd.  "But I ask your pardon!  I</p><p>
recognize a little mistake.  If I may take the liberty to suppose it,</p><p>
you, sir, are probably one of the aesthetic--or shall I rather say</p><p>
ecstatic?--laborers, who have planted themselves hereabouts.  This is</p><p>
your forest of Arden; and you are either the banished Duke in person,</p><p>
or one of the chief nobles in his train.  The melancholy Jacques,</p><p>
perhaps?  Be it so.  In that case, you can probably do me a favor."</p>
<p>
I never, in my life, felt less inclined to confer a favor on any man.</p>
<p>
"I am busy," said I.</p>
<p>
So unexpectedly had the stranger made me sensible of his presence, that</p><p>
he had almost the effect of an apparition; and certainly a less</p><p>
appropriate one (taking into view the dim woodland solitude about us)</p><p>
than if the salvage man of antiquity, hirsute and cinctured with a</p><p>
leafy girdle, had started out of a thicket.  He was still young,</p><p>
seemingly a little under thirty, of a tall and well-developed figure,</p><p>
and as handsome a man as ever I beheld.  The style of his beauty,</p><p>
however, though a masculine style, did not at all commend itself to my</p><p>
taste.  His countenance--I hardly know how to describe the</p><p>
peculiarity--had an indecorum in it, a kind of rudeness, a hard,</p><p>
coarse, forth-putting freedom of expression, which no degree of</p><p>
external polish could have abated one single jot.  Not that it was</p><p>
vulgar.  But he had no fineness of nature; there was in his eyes</p><p>
(although they might have artifice enough of another sort) the naked</p><p>
exposure of something that ought not to be left prominent.  With these</p><p>
vague allusions to what I have seen in other faces as well as his, I</p><p>
leave the quality to be comprehended best--because with an intuitive</p><p>
repugnance--by those who possess least of it.</p>
<p>
His hair, as well as his beard and mustache, was coal-black; his eyes,</p><p>
too, were black and sparkling, and his teeth remarkably brilliant. He</p><p>
was rather carelessly but well and fashionably dressed, in a</p><p>
summer-morning costume.  There was a gold chain, exquisitely wrought,</p><p>
across his vest.  I never saw a smoother or whiter gloss than that upon</p><p>
his shirt-bosom, which had a pin in it, set with a gem that glimmered,</p><p>
in the leafy shadow where he stood, like a living tip of fire.  He</p><p>
carried a stick with a wooden head, carved in vivid imitation of that</p><p>
of a serpent.  I hated him, partly, I do believe, from a comparison of</p><p>
my own homely garb with his well-ordered foppishness.</p>
<p>
"Well, sir," said I, a little ashamed of my first irritation, but still</p><p>
with no waste of civility, "be pleased to speak at once, as I have my</p><p>
own business in hand."</p>
<p>
"I regret that my mode of addressing you was a little unfortunate,"</p><p>
said the stranger, smiling; for he seemed a very acute sort of person,</p><p>
and saw, in some degree, how I stood affected towards him.  "I intended</p><p>
no offence, and shall certainly comport myself with due ceremony</p><p>
hereafter.  I merely wish to make a few inquiries respecting a lady,</p><p>
formerly of my acquaintance, who is now resident in your Community,</p><p>
and, I believe, largely concerned in your social enterprise.  You call</p><p>
her, I think, Zenobia."</p>
<p>
"That is her name in literature," observed I; "a name, too, which</p><p>
possibly she may permit her private friends to know and address her</p><p>
by,--but not one which they feel at liberty to recognize when used of</p><p>
her personally by a stranger or casual acquaintance."</p>
<p>
"Indeed!" answered this disagreeable person; and he turned aside his</p><p>
face for an instant with a brief laugh, which struck me as a noteworthy</p><p>
expression of his character.  "Perhaps I might put forward a claim, on</p><p>
your own grounds, to call the lady by a name so appropriate to her</p><p>
splendid qualities.  But I am willing to know her by any cognomen that</p><p>
you may suggest."</p>
<p>
Heartily wishing that he would be either a little more offensive, or a</p><p>
good deal less so, or break off our intercourse altogether, I mentioned</p><p>
Zenobia's real name.</p>
<p>
"True," said he; "and in general society I have never heard her called</p><p>
otherwise.  And, after all, our discussion of the point has been</p><p>
gratuitous.  My object is only to inquire when, where, and how this</p><p>
lady may most conveniently be seen."</p>
<p>
"At her present residence, of course," I replied.  "You have but to go</p><p>
thither and ask for her.  This very path will lead you within sight of</p><p>
the house; so I wish you good-morning."</p>
<p>
"One moment, if you please," said the stranger.  "The course you</p><p>
indicate would certainly be the proper one, in an ordinary morning</p><p>
call.  But my business is private, personal, and somewhat peculiar.</p><p>
Now, in a community like this, I should judge that any little</p><p>
occurrence is likely to be discussed rather more minutely than would</p><p>
quite suit my views.  I refer solely to myself, you understand, and</p><p>
without intimating that it would be other than a matter of entire</p><p>
indifference to the lady.  In short, I especially desire to see her in</p><p>
private.  If her habits are such as I have known them, she is probably</p><p>
often to be met with in the woods, or by the river-side; and I think</p><p>
you could do me the favor to point out some favorite walk, where, about</p><p>
this hour, I might be fortunate enough to gain an interview."</p>
<p>
I reflected that it would be quite a supererogatory piece of Quixotism</p><p>
in me to undertake the guardianship of Zenobia, who, for my pains,</p><p>
would only make me the butt of endless ridicule, should the fact ever</p><p>
come to her knowledge.  I therefore described a spot which, as often as</p><p>
any other, was Zenobia's resort at this period of the day; nor was it</p><p>
so remote from the farmhouse as to leave her in much peril, whatever</p><p>
might be the stranger's character.</p>
<p>
"A single word more," said he; and his black eyes sparkled at me,</p><p>
whether with fun or malice I knew not, but certainly as if the Devil</p><p>
were peeping out of them.  "Among your fraternity, I understand, there</p><p>
is a certain holy and benevolent blacksmith; a man of iron, in more</p><p>
senses than one; a rough, cross-grained, well-meaning individual,</p><p>
rather boorish in his manners, as might be expected, and by no means of</p><p>
the highest intellectual cultivation.  He is a philanthropical</p><p>
lecturer, with two or three disciples, and a scheme of his own, the</p><p>
preliminary step in which involves a large purchase of land, and the</p><p>
erection of a spacious edifice, at an expense considerably beyond his</p><p>
means; inasmuch as these are to be reckoned in copper or old iron much</p><p>
more conveniently than in gold or silver.  He hammers away upon his one</p><p>
topic as lustily as ever he did upon a horseshoe!  Do you know such a</p><p>
person?"  I shook my head, and was turning away.  "Our friend," he</p><p>
continued, "is described to me as a brawny, shaggy, grim, and</p><p>
ill-favored personage, not particularly well calculated, one would say,</p><p>
to insinuate himself with the softer sex.  Yet, so far has this honest</p><p>
fellow succeeded with one lady whom we wot of, that he anticipates,</p><p>
from her abundant resources, the necessary funds for realizing his plan</p><p>
in brick and mortar!"</p>
<p>
Here the stranger seemed to be so much amused with his sketch of</p><p>
Hollingsworth's character and purposes, that he burst into a fit of</p><p>
merriment, of the same nature as the brief, metallic laugh already</p><p>
alluded to, but immensely prolonged and enlarged.  In the excess of his</p><p>
delight, he opened his mouth wide, and disclosed a gold band around the</p><p>
upper part of his teeth, thereby making it apparent that every one of</p><p>
his brilliant grinders and incisors was a sham.  This discovery</p><p>
affected me very oddly.</p>
<p>
I felt as if the whole man were a moral and physical humbug; his</p><p>
wonderful beauty of face, for aught I knew, might be removable like a</p><p>
mask; and, tall and comely as his figure looked, he was perhaps but a</p><p>
wizened little elf, gray and decrepit, with nothing genuine about him</p><p>
save the wicked expression of his grin.  The fantasy of his spectral</p><p>
character so wrought upon me, together with the contagion of his</p><p>
strange mirth on my sympathies, that I soon began to laugh as loudly as</p><p>
himself.</p>
<p>
By and by, he paused all at once; so suddenly, indeed, that my own</p><p>
cachinnation lasted a moment longer.</p>
<p>
"Ah, excuse me!" said he.  "Our interview seems to proceed more merrily</p><p>
than it began."</p>
<p>
"It ends here," answered I. "And I take shame to myself that my folly</p><p>
has lost me the right of resenting your ridicule of a friend."</p>
<p>
"Pray allow me," said the stranger, approaching a step nearer, and</p><p>
laying his gloved hand on my sleeve.  "One other favor I must ask of</p><p>
you.  You have a young person here at Blithedale, of whom I have</p><p>
heard,--whom, perhaps, I have known,--and in whom, at all events, I</p><p>
take a peculiar interest.  She is one of those delicate, nervous young</p><p>
creatures, not uncommon in New England, and whom I suppose to have</p><p>
become what we find them by the gradual refining away of the physical</p><p>
system among your women.  Some philosophers choose to glorify this</p><p>
habit of body by terming it spiritual; but, in my opinion, it is rather</p><p>
the effect of unwholesome food, bad air, lack of outdoor exercise, and</p><p>
neglect of bathing, on the part of these damsels and their female</p><p>
progenitors, all resulting in a kind of hereditary dyspepsia.  Zenobia,</p><p>
even with her uncomfortable surplus of vitality, is far the better</p><p>
model of womanhood.  But--to revert again to this young person--she</p><p>
goes among you by the name of Priscilla.  Could you possibly afford me</p><p>
the means of speaking with her?"</p>
<p>
"You have made so many inquiries of me," I observed, "that I may at</p><p>
least trouble you with one.  What is your name?"</p>
<p>
He offered me a card, with "Professor Westervelt" engraved on it.  At</p><p>
the same time, as if to vindicate his claim to the professorial</p><p>
dignity, so often assumed on very questionable grounds, he put on a</p><p>
pair of spectacles, which so altered the character of his face that I</p><p>
hardly knew him again.  But I liked the present aspect no better than</p><p>
the former one.</p>
<p>
"I must decline any further connection with your affairs," said I,</p><p>
drawing back.  "I have told you where to find Zenobia.  As for</p><p>
Priscilla, she has closer friends than myself, through whom, if they</p><p>
see fit, you can gain access to her."</p>
<p>
"In that case," returned the Professor, ceremoniously raising his hat,</p><p>
"good-morning to you."</p>
<p>
He took his departure, and was soon out of sight among the windings of</p><p>
the wood-path.  But after a little reflection, I could not help</p><p>
regretting that I had so peremptorily broken off the interview, while</p><p>
the stranger seemed inclined to continue it.  His evident knowledge of</p><p>
matters affecting my three friends might have led to disclosures or</p><p>
inferences that would perhaps have been serviceable.  I was</p><p>
particularly struck with the fact that, ever since the appearance of</p><p>
Priscilla, it had been the tendency of events to suggest and establish</p><p>
a connection between Zenobia and her.  She had come, in the first</p><p>
instance, as if with the sole purpose of claiming Zenobia's protection.</p><p>
Old Moodie's visit, it appeared, was chiefly to ascertain whether this</p><p>
object had been accomplished.  And here, to-day, was the questionable</p><p>
Professor, linking one with the other in his inquiries, and seeking</p><p>
communication with both.</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, my inclination for a ramble having been balked, I lingered</p><p>
in the vicinity of the farm, with perhaps a vague idea that some new</p><p>
event would grow out of Westervelt's proposed interview with Zenobia.</p><p>
My own part in these transactions was singularly subordinate.  It</p><p>
resembled that of the Chorus in a classic play, which seems to be set</p><p>
aloof from the possibility of personal concernment, and bestows the</p><p>
whole measure of its hope or fear, its exultation or sorrow, on the</p><p>
fortunes of others, between whom and itself this sympathy is the only</p><p>
bond.  Destiny, it may be,--the most skilful of stage managers,--seldom</p><p>
chooses to arrange its scenes, and carry forward its drama, without</p><p>
securing the presence of at least one calm observer.  It is his office</p><p>
to give applause when due, and sometimes an inevitable tear, to detect</p><p>
the final fitness of incident to character, and distil in his</p><p>
long-brooding thought the whole morality of the performance.</p>
<p>
Not to be out of the way in case there were need of me in my vocation,</p><p>
and, at the same time, to avoid thrusting myself where neither destiny</p><p>
nor mortals might desire my presence, I remained pretty near the verge</p><p>
of the woodlands.  My position was off the track of Zenobia's customary</p><p>
walk, yet not so remote but that a recognized occasion might speedily</p><p>
have brought me thither.</p>
<p>
XII. COVERDALE'S HERMITAGE</p>
<p>
Long since, in this part of our circumjacent wood, I had found out for</p><p>
myself a little hermitage.  It was a kind of leafy cave, high upward</p><p>
into the air, among the midmost branches of a white-pine tree. A wild</p><p>
grapevine, of unusual size and luxuriance, had twined and twisted</p><p>
itself up into the tree, and, after wreathing the entanglement of its</p><p>
tendrils around almost every bough, had caught hold of three or four</p><p>
neighboring trees, and married the whole clump with a perfectly</p><p>
inextricable knot of polygamy.  Once, while sheltering myself from a</p><p>
summer shower, the fancy had taken me to clamber up into this seemingly</p><p>
impervious mass of foliage.  The branches yielded me a passage, and</p><p>
closed again beneath, as if only a squirrel or a bird had passed.  Far</p><p>
aloft, around the stem of the central pine, behold a perfect nest for</p><p>
Robinson Crusoe or King Charles!  A hollow chamber of rare seclusion</p><p>
had been formed by the decay of some of the pine branches, which the</p><p>
vine had lovingly strangled with its embrace, burying them from the</p><p>
light of day in an aerial sepulchre of its own leaves.  It cost me but</p><p>
little ingenuity to enlarge the interior, and open loopholes through</p><p>
the verdant walls.  Had it ever been my fortune to spend a honeymoon, I</p><p>
should have thought seriously of inviting my bride up thither, where</p><p>
our next neighbors would have been two orioles in another part of the</p><p>
clump.</p>
<p>
It was an admirable place to make verses, tuning the rhythm to the</p><p>
breezy symphony that so often stirred among the vine leaves; or to</p><p>
meditate an essay for "The Dial," in which the many tongues of Nature</p><p>
whispered mysteries, and seemed to ask only a little stronger puff of</p><p>
wind to speak out the solution of its riddle.  Being so pervious to</p><p>
air-currents, it was just the nook, too, for the enjoyment of a cigar.</p><p>
This hermitage was my one exclusive possession while I counted myself a</p><p>
brother of the socialists.  It symbolized my individuality, and aided</p><p>
me in keeping it inviolate.  None ever found me out in it, except,</p><p>
once, a squirrel.  I brought thither no guest, because, after</p><p>
Hollingsworth failed me, there was no longer the man alive with whom I</p><p>
could think of sharing all.  So there I used to sit, owl-like, yet not</p><p>
without liberal and hospitable thoughts.  I counted the innumerable</p><p>
clusters of my vine, and fore-reckoned the abundance of my vintage.  It</p><p>
gladdened me to anticipate the surprise of the Community, when, like an</p><p>
allegorical figure of rich October, I should make my appearance, with</p><p>
shoulders bent beneath the burden of ripe grapes, and some of the</p><p>
crushed ones crimsoning my brow as with a bloodstain.</p>
<p>
Ascending into this natural turret, I peeped in turn out of several of</p><p>
its small windows.  The pine-tree, being ancient, rose high above the</p><p>
rest of the wood, which was of comparatively recent growth.  Even where</p><p>
I sat, about midway between the root and the topmost bough, my position</p><p>
was lofty enough to serve as an observatory, not for starry</p><p>
investigations, but for those sublunary matters in which lay a lore as</p><p>
infinite as that of the planets.  Through one loophole I saw the river</p><p>
lapsing calmly onward, while in the meadow, near its brink, a few of</p><p>
the brethren were digging peat for our winter's fuel.  On the interior</p><p>
cart-road of our farm I discerned Hollingsworth, with a yoke of oxen</p><p>
hitched to a drag of stones, that were to be piled into a fence, on</p><p>
which we employed ourselves at the odd intervals of other labor.  The</p><p>
harsh tones of his voice, shouting to the sluggish steers, made me</p><p>
sensible, even at such a distance, that he was ill at ease, and that</p><p>
the balked philanthropist had the battle-spirit in his heart.</p>
<p>
"Haw, Buck!" quoth he.  "Come along there, ye lazy ones!  What are ye</p><p>
about, now?  Gee!"</p>
<p>
"Mankind, in Hollingsworth's opinion," thought I, "is but another yoke</p><p>
of oxen, as stubborn, stupid, and sluggish as our old Brown and Bright.</p><p>
He vituperates us aloud, and curses us in his heart, and will begin to</p><p>
prick us with the goad-stick, by and by.  But are we his oxen?  And</p><p>
what right has he to be the driver?  And why, when there is enough else</p><p>
to do, should we waste our strength in dragging home the ponderous load</p><p>
of his philanthropic absurdities?  At my height above the earth, the</p><p>
whole matter looks ridiculous!"</p>
<p>
Turning towards the farmhouse, I saw Priscilla (for, though a great way</p><p>
off, the eye of faith assured me that it was she) sitting at Zenobia's</p><p>
window, and making little purses, I suppose; or, perhaps, mending the</p><p>
Community's old linen.  A bird flew past my tree; and, as it clove its</p><p>
way onward into the sunny atmosphere, I flung it a message for</p><p>
Priscilla.</p>
<p>
"Tell her," said I, "that her fragile thread of life has inextricably</p><p>
knotted itself with other and tougher threads, and most likely it will</p><p>
be broken.  Tell her that Zenobia will not be long her friend. Say that</p><p>
Hollingsworth's heart is on fire with his own purpose, but icy for all</p><p>
human affection; and that, if she has given him her love, it is like</p><p>
casting a flower into a sepulchre.  And say that if any mortal really</p><p>
cares for her, it is myself; and not even I for her realities,--poor</p><p>
little seamstress, as Zenobia rightly called her!--but for the</p><p>
fancy-work with which I have idly decked her out!"</p>
<p>
The pleasant scent of the wood, evolved by the hot sun, stole up to my</p><p>
nostrils, as if I had been an idol in its niche.  Many trees mingled</p><p>
their fragrance into a thousand-fold odor.  Possibly there was a</p><p>
sensual influence in the broad light of noon that lay beneath me.  It</p><p>
may have been the cause, in part, that I suddenly found myself</p><p>
possessed by a mood of disbelief in moral beauty or heroism, and a</p><p>
conviction of the folly of attempting to benefit the world. Our</p><p>
especial scheme of reform, which, from my observatory, I could take in</p><p>
with the bodily eye, looked so ridiculous that it was impossible not to</p><p>
laugh aloud.</p>
<p>
"But the joke is a little too heavy," thought I. "If I were wise, I</p><p>
should get out of the scrape with all diligence, and then laugh at my</p><p>
companions for remaining in it."</p>
<p>
While thus musing, I heard with perfect distinctness, somewhere in the</p><p>
wood beneath, the peculiar laugh which I have described as one of the</p><p>
disagreeable characteristics of Professor Westervelt.  It brought my</p><p>
thoughts back to our recent interview.  I recognized as chiefly due to</p><p>
this man's influence the sceptical and sneering view which just now had</p><p>
filled my mental vision in regard to all life's better purposes.  And</p><p>
it was through his eyes, more than my own, that I was looking at</p><p>
Hollingsworth, with his glorious if impracticable dream, and at the</p><p>
noble earthliness of Zenobia's character, and even at Priscilla, whose</p><p>
impalpable grace lay so singularly between disease and beauty.  The</p><p>
essential charm of each had vanished.  There are some spheres the</p><p>
contact with which inevitably degrades the high, debases the pure,</p><p>
deforms the beautiful.  It must be a mind of uncommon strength, and</p><p>
little impressibility, that can permit itself the habit of such</p><p>
intercourse, and not be permanently deteriorated; and yet the</p><p>
Professor's tone represented that of worldly society at large, where a</p><p>
cold scepticism smothers what it can of our spiritual aspirations, and</p><p>
makes the rest ridiculous.  I detested this kind of man; and all the</p><p>
more because a part of my own nature showed itself responsive to him.</p>
<p>
Voices were now approaching through the region of the wood which lay in</p><p>
the vicinity of my tree.  Soon I caught glimpses of two figures--a</p><p>
woman and a man--Zenobia and the stranger--earnestly talking together</p><p>
as they advanced.</p>
<p>
Zenobia had a rich though varying color.  It was, most of the while, a</p><p>
flame, and anon a sudden paleness.  Her eyes glowed, so that their</p><p>
light sometimes flashed upward to me, as when the sun throws a dazzle</p><p>
from some bright object on the ground.  Her gestures were free, and</p><p>
strikingly impressive.  The whole woman was alive with a passionate</p><p>
intensity, which I now perceived to be the phase in which her beauty</p><p>
culminated.  Any passion would have become her well; and passionate</p><p>
love, perhaps, the best of all.  This was not love, but anger, largely</p><p>
intermixed with scorn.  Yet the idea strangely forced itself upon me,</p><p>
that there was a sort of familiarity between these two companions,</p><p>
necessarily the result of an intimate love,--on Zenobia's part, at</p><p>
least,--in days gone by, but which had prolonged itself into as</p><p>
intimate a hatred, for all futurity.  As they passed among the trees,</p><p>
reckless as her movement was, she took good heed that even the hem of</p><p>
her garment should not brush against the stranger's person.  I wondered</p><p>
whether there had always been a chasm, guarded so religiously, betwixt</p><p>
these two.</p>
<p>
As for Westervelt, he was not a whit more warmed by Zenobia's passion</p><p>
than a salamander by the heat of its native furnace.  He would have</p><p>
been absolutely statuesque, save for a look of slight perplexity,</p><p>
tinctured strongly with derision.  It was a crisis in which his</p><p>
intellectual perceptions could not altogether help him out.  He failed</p><p>
to comprehend, and cared but little for comprehending, why Zenobia</p><p>
should put herself into such a fume; but satisfied his mind that it was</p><p>
all folly, and only another shape of a woman's manifold absurdity,</p><p>
which men can never understand.  How many a woman's evil fate has yoked</p><p>
her with a man like this!  Nature thrusts some of us into the world</p><p>
miserably incomplete on the emotional side, with hardly any</p><p>
sensibilities except what pertain to us as animals.  No passion, save</p><p>
of the senses; no holy tenderness, nor the delicacy that results from</p><p>
this.  Externally they bear a close resemblance to other men, and have</p><p>
perhaps all save the finest grace; but when a woman wrecks herself on</p><p>
such a being, she ultimately finds that the real womanhood within her</p><p>
has no corresponding part in him.  Her deepest voice lacks a response;</p><p>
the deeper her cry, the more dead his silence.  The fault may be none</p><p>
of his; he cannot give her what never lived within his soul.  But the</p><p>
wretchedness on her side, and the moral deterioration attendant on a</p><p>
false and shallow life, without strength enough to keep itself sweet,</p><p>
are among the most pitiable wrongs that mortals suffer.</p>
<p>
Now, as I looked down from my upper region at this man and</p><p>
woman,--outwardly so fair a sight, and wandering like two lovers in the</p><p>
wood,--I imagined that Zenobia, at an earlier period of youth, might</p><p>
have fallen into the misfortune above indicated.  And when her</p><p>
passionate womanhood, as was inevitable, had discovered its mistake,</p><p>
here had ensued the character of eccentricity and defiance which</p><p>
distinguished the more public portion of her life.</p>
<p>
Seeing how aptly matters had chanced thus far, I began to think it the</p><p>
design of fate to let me into all Zenobia's secrets, and that therefore</p><p>
the couple would sit down beneath my tree, and carry on a conversation</p><p>
which would leave me nothing to inquire.  No doubt, however, had it so</p><p>
happened, I should have deemed myself honorably bound to warn them of a</p><p>
listener's presence by flinging down a handful of unripe grapes, or by</p><p>
sending an unearthly groan out of my hiding-place, as if this were one</p><p>
of the trees of Dante's ghostly forest.  But real life never arranges</p><p>
itself exactly like a romance. In the first place, they did not sit</p><p>
down at all.  Secondly, even while they passed beneath the tree,</p><p>
Zenobia's utterance was so hasty and broken, and Westervelt's so cool</p><p>
and low, that I hardly could make out an intelligible sentence on</p><p>
either side.  What I seem to remember, I yet suspect, may have been</p><p>
patched together by my fancy, in brooding over the matter afterwards.</p>
<p>
"Why not fling the girl off," said Westervelt, "and let her go?"</p>
<p>
"She clung to me from the first," replied Zenobia.  "I neither know nor</p><p>
care what it is in me that so attaches her.  But she loves me, and I</p><p>
will not fail her."</p>
<p>
"She will plague you, then," said he, "in more ways than one."</p>
<p>
"The poor child!" exclaimed Zenobia.  "She can do me neither good nor</p><p>
harm.  How should she?"</p>
<p>
I know not what reply Westervelt whispered; nor did Zenobia's</p><p>
subsequent exclamation give me any clew, except that it evidently</p><p>
inspired her with horror and disgust.</p>
<p>
"With what kind of a being am I linked?" cried she.  "If my Creator</p><p>
cares aught for my soul, let him release me from this miserable bond!"</p>
<p>
"I did not think it weighed so heavily," said her companion..</p>
<p>
"Nevertheless," answered Zenobia, "it will strangle me at last!"</p>
<p>
And then I heard her utter a helpless sort of moan; a sound which,</p><p>
struggling out of the heart of a person of her pride and strength,</p><p>
affected me more than if she had made the wood dolorously vocal with a</p><p>
thousand shrieks and wails.</p>
<p>
Other mysterious words, besides what are above written, they spoke</p><p>
together; but I understood no more, and even question whether I fairly</p><p>
understood so much as this.  By long brooding over our recollections,</p><p>
we subtilize them into something akin to imaginary stuff, and hardly</p><p>
capable of being distinguished from it.  In a few moments they were</p><p>
completely beyond ear-shot.  A breeze stirred after them, and awoke the</p><p>
leafy tongues of the surrounding trees, which forthwith began to</p><p>
babble, as if innumerable gossips had all at once got wind of Zenobia's</p><p>
secret.  But, as the breeze grew stronger, its voice among the branches</p><p>
was as if it said, "Hush!  Hush!" and I resolved that to no mortal</p><p>
would I disclose what I had heard.  And, though there might be room for</p><p>
casuistry, such, I conceive, is the most equitable rule in all similar</p><p>
conjunctures.</p>
<p>
XIII. ZENOBIA'S LEGEND</p>
<p>
The illustrious Society of Blithedale, though it toiled in downright</p><p>
earnest for the good of mankind, yet not unfrequently illuminated its</p><p>
laborious life with an afternoon or evening of pastime.  Picnics under</p><p>
the trees were considerably in vogue; and, within doors, fragmentary</p><p>
bits of theatrical performance, such as single acts of tragedy or</p><p>
comedy, or dramatic proverbs and charades.  Zenobia, besides, was fond</p><p>
of giving us readings from Shakespeare, and often with a depth of</p><p>
tragic power, or breadth of comic effect, that made one feel it an</p><p>
intolerable wrong to the world that she did not at once go upon the</p><p>
stage.  Tableaux vivants were another of our occasional modes of</p><p>
amusement, in which scarlet shawls, old silken robes, ruffs, velvets,</p><p>
furs, and all kinds of miscellaneous trumpery converted our familiar</p><p>
companions into the people of a pictorial world.  We had been thus</p><p>
engaged on the evening after the incident narrated in the last chapter.</p><p>
Several splendid works of art--either arranged after engravings from</p><p>
the old masters, or original illustrations of scenes in history or</p><p>
romance--had been presented, and we were earnestly entreating Zenobia</p><p>
for more.</p>
<p>
She stood with a meditative air, holding a large piece of gauze, or</p><p>
some such ethereal stuff, as if considering what picture should next</p><p>
occupy the frame; while at her feet lay a heap of many-colored</p><p>
garments, which her quick fancy and magic skill could so easily convert</p><p>
into gorgeous draperies for heroes and princesses.</p>
<p>
"I am getting weary of this," said she, after a moment's thought. "Our</p><p>
own features, and our own figures and airs, show a little too</p><p>
intrusively through all the characters we assume.  We have so much</p><p>
familiarity with one another's realities, that we cannot remove</p><p>
ourselves, at pleasure, into an imaginary sphere.  Let us have no more</p><p>
pictures to-night; but, to make you what poor amends I can, how would</p><p>
you like to have me trump up a wild, spectral legend, on the spur of</p><p>
the moment?"</p>
<p>
Zenobia had the gift of telling a fanciful little story, off-hand, in a</p><p>
way that made it greatly more effective than it was usually found to be</p><p>
when she afterwards elaborated the same production with her pen. Her</p><p>
proposal, therefore, was greeted with acclamation.</p>
<p>
"Oh, a story, a story, by all means!" cried the young girls.  "No</p><p>
matter how marvellous; we will believe it, every word.  And let it be a</p><p>
ghost story, if you please."</p>
<p>
"No, not exactly a ghost story," answered Zenobia; "but something so</p><p>
nearly like it that you shall hardly tell the difference.  And,</p><p>
Priscilla, stand you before me, where I may look at you, and get my</p><p>
inspiration out of your eyes.  They are very deep and dreamy to-night."</p>
<p>
I know not whether the following version of her story will retain any</p><p>
portion of its pristine character; but, as Zenobia told it wildly and</p><p>
rapidly, hesitating at no extravagance, and dashing at absurdities</p><p>
which I am too timorous to repeat,--giving it the varied emphasis of</p><p>
her inimitable voice, and the pictorial illustration of her mobile</p><p>
face, while through it all we caught the freshest aroma of the</p><p>
thoughts, as they came bubbling out of her mind,--thus narrated, and</p><p>
thus heard, the legend seemed quite a remarkable affair.  I scarcely</p><p>
knew, at the time, whether she intended us to laugh or be more</p><p>
seriously impressed.  From beginning to end, it was undeniable</p><p>
nonsense, but not necessarily the worse for that.</p>
<p>
THE SILVERY VEIL</p>
<p>
You have heard, my dear friends, of the Veiled Lady, who grew suddenly</p><p>
so very famous, a few months ago.  And have you never thought how</p><p>
remarkable it was that this marvellous creature should vanish, all at</p><p>
once, while her renown was on the increase, before the public had grown</p><p>
weary of her, and when the enigma of her character, instead of being</p><p>
solved, presented itself more mystically at every exhibition?  Her last</p><p>
appearance, as you know, was before a crowded audience.  The next</p><p>
evening,--although the bills had announced her, at the corner of every</p><p>
street, in red letters of a gigantic size,--there was no Veiled Lady to</p><p>
be seen!  Now, listen to my simple little tale, and you shall hear the</p><p>
very latest incident in the known life--(if life it may be called,</p><p>
which seemed to have no more reality than the candle-light image of</p><p>
one's self which peeps at us outside of a dark windowpane)--the life of</p><p>
this shadowy phenomenon.</p>
<p>
A party of young gentlemen, you are to understand, were enjoying</p><p>
themselves, one afternoon,--as young gentlemen are sometimes fond of</p><p>
doing,--over a bottle or two of champagne; and, among other ladies less</p><p>
mysterious, the subject of the Veiled Lady, as was very natural,</p><p>
happened to come up before them for discussion.  She rose, as it were,</p><p>
with the sparkling effervescence of their wine, and appeared in a more</p><p>
airy and fantastic light on account of the medium through which they</p><p>
saw her.  They repeated to one another, between jest and earnest, all</p><p>
the wild stories that were in vogue; nor, I presume, did they hesitate</p><p>
to add any small circumstance that the inventive whim of the moment</p><p>
might suggest, to heighten the marvellousness of their theme.</p>
<p>
"But what an audacious report was that," observed one, "which pretended</p><p>
to assert the identity of this strange creature with a young</p><p>
lady,"--and here he mentioned her name,--"the daughter of one of our</p><p>
most distinguished families!"</p>
<p>
"Ah, there is more in that story than can well be accounted for,"</p><p>
remarked another.  "I have it on good authority, that the young lady in</p><p>
question is invariably out of sight, and not to be traced, even by her</p><p>
own family, at the hours when the Veiled Lady is before the public; nor</p><p>
can any satisfactory explanation be given of her disappearance.  And</p><p>
just look at the thing: Her brother is a young fellow of spirit.  He</p><p>
cannot but be aware of these rumors in reference to his sister.  Why,</p><p>
then, does he not come forward to defend her character, unless he is</p><p>
conscious that an investigation would only make the matter worse?"</p>
<p>
It is essential to the purposes of my legend to distinguish one of</p><p>
these young gentlemen from his companions; so, for the sake of a soft</p><p>
and pretty name (such as we of the literary sisterhood invariably</p><p>
bestow upon our heroes), I deem it fit to call him Theodore.</p>
<p>
"Pshaw!" exclaimed Theodore; "her brother is no such fool!  Nobody,</p><p>
unless his brain be as full of bubbles as this wine, can seriously</p><p>
think of crediting that ridiculous rumor.  Why, if my senses did not</p><p>
play me false (which never was the case yet), I affirm that I saw that</p><p>
very lady, last evening, at the exhibition, while this veiled</p><p>
phenomenon was playing off her juggling tricks!  What can you say to</p><p>
that?"</p>
<p>
"Oh, it was a spectral illusion that you saw!" replied his friends,</p><p>
with a general laugh.  "The Veiled Lady is quite up to such a thing."</p>
<p>
However, as the above-mentioned fable could not hold its ground against</p><p>
Theodore's downright refutation, they went on to speak of other stories</p><p>
which the wild babble of the town had set afloat.  Some upheld that the</p><p>
veil covered the most beautiful countenance in the world; others,--and</p><p>
certainly with more reason, considering the sex of the Veiled</p><p>
Lady,--that the face was the most hideous and horrible, and that this</p><p>
was her sole motive for hiding it.  It was the face of a corpse; it was</p><p>
the head of a skeleton; it was a monstrous visage, with snaky locks,</p><p>
like Medusa's, and one great red eye in the centre of the forehead.</p><p>
Again, it was affirmed that there was no single and unchangeable set of</p><p>
features beneath the veil; but that whosoever should be bold enough to</p><p>
lift it would behold the features of that person, in all the world, who</p><p>
was destined to be his fate; perhaps he would be greeted by the tender</p><p>
smile of the woman whom he loved, or, quite as probably, the deadly</p><p>
scowl of his bitterest enemy would throw a blight over his life.  They</p><p>
quoted, moreover, this startling explanation of the whole affair: that</p><p>
the magician who exhibited the Veiled Lady--and who, by the bye, was</p><p>
the handsomest man in the whole world--had bartered his own soul for</p><p>
seven years' possession of a familiar fiend, and that the last year of</p><p>
the contract was wearing towards its close.</p>
<p>
If it were worth our while, I could keep you till an hour beyond</p><p>
midnight listening to a thousand such absurdities as these.  But</p><p>
finally our friend Theodore, who prided himself upon his common-sense,</p><p>
found the matter getting quite beyond his patience.</p>
<p>
"I offer any wager you like," cried he, setting down his glass so</p><p>
forcibly as to break the stem of it, "that this very evening I find out</p><p>
the mystery of the Veiled Lady!"</p>
<p>
Young men, I am told, boggle at nothing over their wine; so, after a</p><p>
little more talk, a wager of considerable amount was actually laid, the</p><p>
money staked, and Theodore left to choose his own method of settling</p><p>
the dispute.</p>
<p>
How he managed it I know not, nor is it of any great importance to this</p><p>
veracious legend.  The most natural way, to be sure, was by bribing the</p><p>
doorkeeper,--or possibly he preferred clambering in at the window.</p><p>
But, at any rate, that very evening, while the exhibition was going</p><p>
forward in the hall, Theodore contrived to gain admittance into the</p><p>
private withdrawing-room whither the Veiled Lady was accustomed to</p><p>
retire at the close of her performances.  There he waited, listening, I</p><p>
suppose, to the stifled hum of the great audience; and no doubt he</p><p>
could distinguish the deep tones of the magician, causing the wonders</p><p>
that he wrought to appear more dark and intricate, by his mystic</p><p>
pretence of an explanation.  Perhaps, too, in the intervals of the wild</p><p>
breezy music which accompanied the exhibition, he might hear the low</p><p>
voice of the Veiled Lady, conveying her sibylline responses.  Firm as</p><p>
Theodore's nerves might be, and much as he prided himself on his sturdy</p><p>
perception of realities, I should not be surprised if his heart</p><p>
throbbed at a little more than its ordinary rate.</p>
<p>
Theodore concealed himself behind a screen.  In due time the</p><p>
performance was brought to a close, and whether the door was softly</p><p>
opened, or whether her bodiless presence came through the wall, is more</p><p>
than I can say, but, all at once, without the young man's knowing how</p><p>
it happened, a veiled figure stood in the centre of the room.  It was</p><p>
one thing to be in presence of this mystery in the hall of exhibition,</p><p>
where the warm, dense life of hundreds of other mortals kept up the</p><p>
beholder's courage, and distributed her influence among so many; it was</p><p>
another thing to be quite alone with her, and that, too, with a</p><p>
hostile, or, at least, an unauthorized and unjustifiable purpose.  I</p><p>
further imagine that Theodore now began to be sensible of something</p><p>
more serious in his enterprise than he had been quite aware of while he</p><p>
sat with his boon-companions over their sparkling wine.</p>
<p>
Very strange, it must be confessed, was the movement with which the</p><p>
figure floated to and fro over the carpet, with the silvery veil</p><p>
covering her from head to foot; so impalpable, so ethereal, so without</p><p>
substance, as the texture seemed, yet hiding her every outline in an</p><p>
impenetrability like that of midnight.  Surely, she did not walk!  She</p><p>
floated, and flitted, and hovered about the room; no sound of a</p><p>
footstep, no perceptible motion of a limb; it was as if a wandering</p><p>
breeze wafted her before it, at its own wild and gentle pleasure.  But,</p><p>
by and by, a purpose began to be discernible, throughout the seeming</p><p>
vagueness of her unrest.  She was in quest of something.  Could it be</p><p>
that a subtile presentiment had informed her of the young man's</p><p>
presence?  And if so, did the Veiled Lady seek or did she shun him?</p><p>
The doubt in Theodore's mind was speedily resolved; for, after a moment</p><p>
or two of these erratic flutterings, she advanced more decidedly, and</p><p>
stood motionless before the screen.</p>
<p>
"Thou art here!" said a soft, low voice.  "Come forth, Theodore!" Thus</p><p>
summoned by his name, Theodore, as a man of courage, had no choice.  He</p><p>
emerged from his concealment, and presented himself before the Veiled</p><p>
Lady, with the wine-flush, it may be, quite gone out of his cheeks.</p>
<p>
"What wouldst thou with me?" she inquired, with the same gentle</p><p>
composure that was in her former utterance.</p>
<p>
"Mysterious creature," replied Theodore, "I would know who and what you</p><p>
are!"</p>
<p>
"My lips are forbidden to betray the secret," said the Veiled Lady.</p>
<p>
"At whatever risk, I must discover it," rejoined Theodore.</p>
<p>
"Then," said the Mystery, "there is no way save to lift my veil."</p>
<p>
And Theodore, partly recovering his audacity, stept forward on the</p><p>
instant, to do as the Veiled Lady had suggested.  But she floated</p><p>
backward to the opposite side of the room, as if the young man's breath</p><p>
had possessed power enough to waft her away.</p>
<p>
"Pause, one little instant," said the soft, low voice, "and learn the</p><p>
conditions of what thou art so bold to undertake.  Thou canst go hence,</p><p>
and think of me no more; or, at thy option, thou canst lift this</p><p>
mysterious veil, beneath which I am a sad and lonely prisoner, in a</p><p>
bondage which is worse to me than death.  But, before raising it, I</p><p>
entreat thee, in all maiden modesty, to bend forward and impress a kiss</p><p>
where my breath stirs the veil; and my virgin lips shall come forward</p><p>
to meet thy lips; and from that instant, Theodore, thou shalt be mine,</p><p>
and I thine, with never more a veil between us.  And all the felicity</p><p>
of earth and of the future world shall be thine and mine together.  So</p><p>
much may a maiden say behind the veil.  If thou shrinkest from this,</p><p>
there is yet another way."  "And what is that?" asked Theodore.  "Dost</p><p>
thou hesitate," said the Veiled Lady, "to pledge thyself to me, by</p><p>
meeting these lips of mine, while the veil yet hides my face?  Has not</p><p>
thy heart recognized me?  Dost thou come hither, not in holy faith, nor</p><p>
with a pure and generous purpose, but in scornful scepticism and idle</p><p>
curiosity?  Still, thou mayest lift the veil!  But, from that instant,</p><p>
Theodore, I am doomed to be thy evil fate; nor wilt thou ever taste</p><p>
another breath of happiness!"</p>
<p>
There was a shade of inexpressible sadness in the utterance of these</p><p>
last words.  But Theodore, whose natural tendency was towards</p><p>
scepticism, felt himself almost injured and insulted by the Veiled</p><p>
Lady's proposal that he should pledge himself, for life and eternity,</p><p>
to so questionable a creature as herself; or even that she should</p><p>
suggest an inconsequential kiss, taking into view the probability that</p><p>
her face was none of the most bewitching.  A delightful idea, truly,</p><p>
that he should salute the lips of a dead girl, or the jaws of a</p><p>
skeleton, or the grinning cavity of a monster's mouth!  Even should she</p><p>
prove a comely maiden enough in other respects, the odds were ten to</p><p>
one that her teeth were defective; a terrible drawback on the</p><p>
delectableness of a kiss.</p>
<p>
"Excuse me, fair lady," said Theodore, and I think he nearly burst into</p><p>
a laugh, "if I prefer to lift the veil first; and for this affair of</p><p>
the kiss, we may decide upon it afterwards."</p>
<p>
"Thou hast made thy choice," said the sweet, sad voice behind the veil;</p><p>
and there seemed a tender but unresentful sense of wrong done to</p><p>
womanhood by the young man's contemptuous interpretation of her offer.</p><p>
"I must not counsel thee to pause, although thy fate is still in thine</p><p>
own hand!"</p>
<p>
Grasping at the veil, he flung it upward, and caught a glimpse of a</p><p>
pale, lovely face beneath; just one momentary glimpse, and then the</p><p>
apparition vanished, and the silvery veil fluttered slowly down and lay</p><p>
upon the floor.  Theodore was alone.  Our legend leaves him there. His</p><p>
retribution was, to pine forever and ever for another sight of that</p><p>
dim, mournful face,--which might have been his life-long household</p><p>
fireside joy,--to desire, and waste life in a feverish quest, and never</p><p>
meet it more.</p>
<p>
But what, in good sooth, had become of the Veiled Lady?  Had all her</p><p>
existence been comprehended within that mysterious veil, and was she</p><p>
now annihilated?  Or was she a spirit, with a heavenly essence, but</p><p>
which might have been tamed down to human bliss, had Theodore been</p><p>
brave and true enough to claim her?  Hearken, my sweet friends,--and</p><p>
hearken, dear Priscilla,--and you shall learn the little more that</p><p>
Zenobia can tell you.</p>
<p>
Just at the moment, so far as can be ascertained, when the Veiled Lady</p><p>
vanished, a maiden, pale and shadowy, rose up amid a knot of visionary</p><p>
people, who were seeking for the better life.  She was so gentle and so</p><p>
sad,--a nameless melancholy gave her such hold upon their</p><p>
sympathies,--that they never thought of questioning whence she came.</p><p>
She might have heretofore existed, or her thin substance might have</p><p>
been moulded out of air at the very instant when they first beheld her.</p><p>
It was all one to them; they took her to their hearts. Among them was a</p><p>
lady to whom, more than to all the rest, this pale, mysterious girl</p><p>
attached herself.</p>
<p>
But one morning the lady was wandering in the woods, and there met her</p><p>
a figure in an Oriental robe, with a dark beard, and holding in his</p><p>
hand a silvery veil.  He motioned her to stay.  Being a woman of some</p><p>
nerve, she did not shriek, nor run away, nor faint, as many ladies</p><p>
would have been apt to do, but stood quietly, and bade him speak.  The</p><p>
truth was, she had seen his face before, but had never feared it,</p><p>
although she knew him to be a terrible magician.</p>
<p>
"Lady," said he, with a warning gesture, "you are in peril!"  "Peril!"</p><p>
she exclaimed.  "And of what nature?"</p>
<p>
"There is a certain maiden," replied the magician, "who has come out of</p><p>
the realm of mystery, and made herself your most intimate companion.</p><p>
Now, the fates have so ordained it, that, whether by her own will or</p><p>
no, this stranger is your deadliest enemy.  In love, in worldly</p><p>
fortune, in all your pursuit of happiness, she is doomed to fling a</p><p>
blight over your prospects.  There is but one possibility of thwarting</p><p>
her disastrous influence."</p>
<p>
"Then tell me that one method," said the lady.</p>
<p>
"Take this veil," he answered, holding forth the silvery texture. "It</p><p>
is a spell; it is a powerful enchantment, which I wrought for her sake,</p><p>
and beneath which she was once my prisoner.  Throw it, at unawares,</p><p>
over the head of this secret foe, stamp your foot, and cry, 'Arise,</p><p>
Magician!  Here is the Veiled Lady!' and immediately I will rise up</p><p>
through the earth, and seize her; and from that moment you are safe!"</p>
<p>
So the lady took the silvery veil, which was like woven air, or like</p><p>
some substance airier than nothing, and that would float upward and be</p><p>
lost among the clouds, were she once to let it go.  Returning homeward,</p><p>
she found the shadowy girl amid the knot of visionary</p><p>
transcendentalists, who were still seeking for the better life.  She</p><p>
was joyous now, and had a rose-bloom in her cheeks, and was one of the</p><p>
prettiest creatures, and seemed one of the happiest, that the world</p><p>
could show.  But the lady stole noiselessly behind her and threw the</p><p>
veil over her head.  As the slight, ethereal texture sank inevitably</p><p>
down over her figure, the poor girl strove to raise it, and met her</p><p>
dear friend's eyes with one glance of mortal terror, and deep, deep</p><p>
reproach.  It could not change her purpose.</p>
<p>
"Arise, Magician!" she exclaimed, stamping her foot upon the earth.</p><p>
"Here is the Veiled Lady!"</p>
<p>
At the word, up rose the bearded man in the Oriental robes,--the</p><p>
beautiful, the dark magician, who had bartered away his soul!  He threw</p><p>
his arms around the Veiled Lady, and she was his bond-slave for</p><p>
evermore!</p>
<p>
Zenobia, all this while, had been holding the piece of gauze, and so</p><p>
managed it as greatly to increase the dramatic effect of the legend at</p><p>
those points where the magic veil was to be described.  Arriving at the</p><p>
catastrophe, and uttering the fatal words, she flung the gauze over</p><p>
Priscilla's head; and for an instant her auditors held their breath,</p><p>
half expecting, I verily believe, that the magician would start up</p><p>
through the floor, and carry off our poor little friend before our eyes.</p>
<p>
As for Priscilla, she stood droopingly in the midst of us, making no</p><p>
attempt to remove the veil.</p>
<p>
"How do you find yourself, my love?" said Zenobia, lifting a corner of</p><p>
the gauze, and peeping beneath it with a mischievous smile.  "Ah, the</p><p>
dear little soul!  Why, she is really going to faint!  Mr. Coverdale,</p><p>
Mr. Coverdale, pray bring a glass of water!"</p>
<p>
Her nerves being none of the strongest, Priscilla hardly recovered her</p><p>
equanimity during the rest of the evening.  This, to be sure, was a</p><p>
great pity; but, nevertheless, we thought it a very bright idea of</p><p>
Zenobia's to bring her legend to so effective a conclusion.</p>
<p>
XIV. ELIOT'S PULPIT</p>
<p>
Our Sundays at Blithedale were not ordinarily kept with such rigid</p><p>
observance as might have befitted the descendants of the Pilgrims,</p><p>
whose high enterprise, as we sometimes flattered ourselves, we had</p><p>
taken up, and were carrying it onward and aloft, to a point which they</p><p>
never dreamed of attaining.</p>
<p>
On that hallowed day, it is true, we rested from our labors.  Our oxen,</p><p>
relieved from their week-day yoke, roamed at large through the pasture;</p><p>
each yoke-fellow, however, keeping close beside his mate, and</p><p>
continuing to acknowledge, from the force of habit and sluggish</p><p>
sympathy, the union which the taskmaster had imposed for his own hard</p><p>
ends.  As for us human yoke-fellows, chosen companions of toil, whose</p><p>
hoes had clinked together throughout the week, we wandered off, in</p><p>
various directions, to enjoy our interval of repose.  Some, I believe,</p><p>
went devoutly to the village church.  Others, it may be, ascended a</p><p>
city or a country pulpit, wearing the clerical robe with so much</p><p>
dignity that you would scarcely have suspected the yeoman's frock to</p><p>
have been flung off only since milking-time.  Others took long rambles</p><p>
among the rustic lanes and by-paths, pausing to look at black old</p><p>
farmhouses, with their sloping roofs; and at the modern cottage, so</p><p>
like a plaything that it seemed as if real joy or sorrow could have no</p><p>
scope within; and at the more pretending villa, with its range of</p><p>
wooden columns supporting the needless insolence of a great portico.</p><p>
Some betook themselves into the wide, dusky barn, and lay there for</p><p>
hours together on the odorous hay; while the sunstreaks and the shadows</p><p>
strove together,--these to make the barn solemn, those to make it</p><p>
cheerful,--and both were conquerors; and the swallows twittered a</p><p>
cheery anthem, flashing into sight, or vanishing as they darted to and</p><p>
fro among the golden rules of sunshine.  And others went a little way</p><p>
into the woods, and threw themselves on mother earth, pillowing their</p><p>
heads on a heap of moss, the green decay of an old log; and, dropping</p><p>
asleep, the bumblebees and mosquitoes sung and buzzed about their ears,</p><p>
causing the slumberers to twitch and start, without awaking.</p>
<p>
With Hollingsworth, Zenobia, Priscilla, and myself, it grew to be a</p><p>
custom to spend the Sabbath afternoon at a certain rock.  It was known</p><p>
to us under the name of Eliot's pulpit, from a tradition that the</p><p>
venerable Apostle Eliot had preached there, two centuries gone by, to</p><p>
an Indian auditory.  The old pine forest, through which the Apostle's</p><p>
voice was wont to sound, had fallen an immemorial time ago. But the</p><p>
soil, being of the rudest and most broken surface, had apparently never</p><p>
been brought under tillage; other growths, maple and beech and birch,</p><p>
had succeeded to the primeval trees; so that it was still as wild a</p><p>
tract of woodland as the great-great-great-great grandson of one of</p><p>
Eliot's Indians (had any such posterity been in existence) could have</p><p>
desired for the site and shelter of his wigwam. These after-growths,</p><p>
indeed, lose the stately solemnity of the original forest.  If left in</p><p>
due neglect, however, they run into an entanglement of softer wildness,</p><p>
among the rustling leaves of which the sun can scatter cheerfulness as</p><p>
it never could among the dark-browed pines.</p>
<p>
The rock itself rose some twenty or thirty feet, a shattered granite</p><p>
bowlder, or heap of bowlders, with an irregular outline and many</p><p>
fissures, out of which sprang shrubs, bushes, and even trees; as if the</p><p>
scanty soil within those crevices were sweeter to their roots than any</p><p>
other earth.  At the base of the pulpit, the broken bowlders inclined</p><p>
towards each other, so as to form a shallow cave, within which our</p><p>
little party had sometimes found protection from a summer shower.  On</p><p>
the threshold, or just across it, grew a tuft of pale columbines, in</p><p>
their season, and violets, sad and shadowy recluses, such as Priscilla</p><p>
was when we first knew her; children of the sun, who had never seen</p><p>
their father, but dwelt among damp mosses, though not akin to them.  At</p><p>
the summit, the rock was overshadowed by the canopy of a birch-tree,</p><p>
which served as a sounding-board for the pulpit.  Beneath this shade</p><p>
(with my eyes of sense half shut and those of the imagination widely</p><p>
opened) I used to see the holy Apostle of the Indians, with the</p><p>
sunlight flickering down upon him through the leaves, and glorifying</p><p>
his figure as with the half-perceptible glow of a transfiguration.</p>
<p>
I the more minutely describe the rock, and this little Sabbath</p><p>
solitude, because Hollingsworth, at our solicitation, often ascended</p><p>
Eliot's pulpit, and not exactly preached, but talked to us, his few</p><p>
disciples, in a strain that rose and fell as naturally as the wind's</p><p>
breath among the leaves of the birch-tree.  No other speech of man has</p><p>
ever moved me like some of those discourses.  It seemed most pitiful--a</p><p>
positive calamity to the world--that a treasury of golden thoughts</p><p>
should thus be scattered, by the liberal handful, down among us three,</p><p>
when a thousand hearers might have been the richer for them; and</p><p>
Hollingsworth the richer, likewise, by the sympathy of multitudes.</p><p>
After speaking much or little, as might happen, he would descend from</p><p>
his gray pulpit, and generally fling himself at full length on the</p><p>
ground, face downward.  Meanwhile, we talked around him on such topics</p><p>
as were suggested by the discourse.</p>
<p>
Since her interview with Westervelt, Zenobia's continual inequalities</p><p>
of temper had been rather difficult for her friends to bear.  On the</p><p>
first Sunday after that incident, when Hollingsworth had clambered down</p><p>
from Eliot's pulpit, she declaimed with great earnestness and passion,</p><p>
nothing short of anger, on the injustice which the world did to women,</p><p>
and equally to itself, by not allowing them, in freedom and honor, and</p><p>
with the fullest welcome, their natural utterance in public.</p>
<p>
"It shall not always be so!" cried she.  "If I live another year, I</p><p>
will lift up my own voice in behalf of woman's wider liberty!"</p>
<p>
She perhaps saw me smile.</p>
<p>
"What matter of ridicule do you find in this, Miles Coverdale?"</p><p>
exclaimed Zenobia, with a flash of anger in her eyes.  "That smile,</p><p>
permit me to say, makes me suspicious of a low tone of feeling and</p><p>
shallow thought.  It is my belief--yes, and my prophecy, should I die</p><p>
before it happens--that, when my sex shall achieve its rights, there</p><p>
will be ten eloquent women where there is now one eloquent man.  Thus</p><p>
far, no woman in the world has ever once spoken out her whole heart and</p><p>
her whole mind.  The mistrust and disapproval of the vast bulk of</p><p>
society throttles us, as with two gigantic hands at our throats!  We</p><p>
mumble a few weak words, and leave a thousand better ones unsaid. You</p><p>
let us write a little, it is true, on a limited range of subjects. But</p><p>
the pen is not for woman.  Her power is too natural and immediate.  It</p><p>
is with the living voice alone that she can compel the world to</p><p>
recognize the light of her intellect and the depth of her heart!"</p>
<p>
Now,--though I could not well say so to Zenobia,--I had not smiled from</p><p>
any unworthy estimate of woman, or in denial of the claims which she is</p><p>
beginning to put forth.  What amused and puzzled me was the fact, that</p><p>
women, however intellectually superior, so seldom disquiet themselves</p><p>
about the rights or wrongs of their sex, unless their own individual</p><p>
affections chance to lie in idleness, or to be ill at ease. They are</p><p>
not natural reformers, but become such by the pressure of exceptional</p><p>
misfortune.  I could measure Zenobia's inward trouble by the animosity</p><p>
with which she now took up the general quarrel of woman against man.</p>
<p>
"I will give you leave, Zenobia," replied I, "to fling your utmost</p><p>
scorn upon me, if you ever hear me utter a sentiment unfavorable to the</p><p>
widest liberty which woman has yet dreamed of.  I would give her all</p><p>
she asks, and add a great deal more, which she will not be the party to</p><p>
demand, but which men, if they were generous and wise, would grant of</p><p>
their own free motion.  For instance, I should love dearly--for the</p><p>
next thousand years, at least--to have all government devolve into the</p><p>
hands of women.  I hate to be ruled by my own sex; it excites my</p><p>
jealousy, and wounds my pride.  It is the iron sway of bodily force</p><p>
which abases us, in our compelled submission.  But how sweet the free,</p><p>
generous courtesy with which I would kneel before a woman-ruler!"</p>
<p>
"Yes, if she were young and beautiful," said Zenobia, laughing.  "But</p><p>
how if she were sixty, and a fright?"</p>
<p>
"Ah! it is you that rate womanhood low," said I. "But let me go on. I</p><p>
have never found it possible to suffer a bearded priest so near my</p><p>
heart and conscience as to do me any spiritual good.  I blush at the</p><p>
very thought!  Oh, in the better order of things, Heaven grant that the</p><p>
ministry of souls may be left in charge of women!  The gates of the</p><p>
Blessed City will be thronged with the multitude that enter in, when</p><p>
that day comes!  The task belongs to woman.  God meant it for her.  He</p><p>
has endowed her with the religious sentiment in its utmost depth and</p><p>
purity, refined from that gross, intellectual alloy with which every</p><p>
masculine theologist--save only One, who merely veiled himself in</p><p>
mortal and masculine shape, but was, in truth, divine--has been prone</p><p>
to mingle it.  I have always envied the Catholics their faith in that</p><p>
sweet, sacred Virgin Mother, who stands between them and the Deity,</p><p>
intercepting somewhat of his awful splendor, but permitting his love to</p><p>
stream upon the worshipper more intelligibly to human comprehension</p><p>
through the medium of a woman's tenderness. Have I not said enough,</p><p>
Zenobia?"</p>
<p>
"I cannot think that this is true," observed Priscilla, who had been</p><p>
gazing at me with great, disapproving eyes.  "And I am sure I do not</p><p>
wish it to be true!"</p>
<p>
"Poor child!" exclaimed Zenobia, rather contemptuously.  "She is the</p><p>
type of womanhood, such as man has spent centuries in making it.  He is</p><p>
never content unless he can degrade himself by stooping towards what he</p><p>
loves.  In denying us our rights, he betrays even more blindness to his</p><p>
own interests than profligate disregard of ours!"</p>
<p>
"Is this true?" asked Priscilla with simplicity, turning to</p><p>
Hollingsworth.  "Is it all true, that Mr. Coverdale and Zenobia have</p><p>
been saying?"</p>
<p>
"No, Priscilla!" answered Hollingsworth with his customary bluntness.</p><p>
"They have neither of them spoken one true word yet."</p>
<p>
"Do you despise woman?" said Zenobia.</p>
<p>
"Ah, Hollingsworth, that would be most ungrateful!"</p>
<p>
"Despise her?  No!" cried Hollingsworth, lifting his great shaggy head</p><p>
and shaking it at us, while his eyes glowed almost fiercely. "She is</p><p>
the most admirable handiwork of God, in her true place and character.</p><p>
Her place is at man's side.  Her office, that of the sympathizer; the</p><p>
unreserved, unquestioning believer; the recognition, withheld in every</p><p>
other manner, but given, in pity, through woman's heart, lest man</p><p>
should utterly lose faith in himself; the echo of God's own voice,</p><p>
pronouncing, 'It is well done!' All the separate action of woman is,</p><p>
and ever has been, and always shall be, false, foolish, vain,</p><p>
destructive of her own best and holiest qualities, void of every good</p><p>
effect, and productive of intolerable mischiefs! Man is a wretch</p><p>
without woman; but woman is a monster--and, thank Heaven, an almost</p><p>
impossible and hitherto imaginary monster--without man as her</p><p>
acknowledged principal!  As true as I had once a mother whom I loved,</p><p>
were there any possible prospect of woman's taking the social stand</p><p>
which some of them,--poor, miserable, abortive creatures, who only</p><p>
dream of such things because they have missed woman's peculiar</p><p>
happiness, or because nature made them really neither man nor</p><p>
woman!--if there were a chance of their attaining the end which these</p><p>
petticoated monstrosities have in view, I would call upon my own sex to</p><p>
use its physical force, that unmistakable evidence of sovereignty, to</p><p>
scourge them back within their proper bounds!  But it will not be</p><p>
needful.  The heart of time womanhood knows where its own sphere is,</p><p>
and never seeks to stray beyond it!"</p>
<p>
Never was mortal blessed--if blessing it were--with a glance of such</p><p>
entire acquiescence and unquestioning faith, happy in its completeness,</p><p>
as our little Priscilla unconsciously bestowed on Hollingsworth.  She</p><p>
seemed to take the sentiment from his lips into her heart, and brood</p><p>
over it in perfect content.  The very woman whom he pictured--the</p><p>
gentle parasite, the soft reflection of a more powerful existence--sat</p><p>
there at his feet.</p>
<p>
I looked at Zenobia, however, fully expecting her to resent--as I felt,</p><p>
by the indignant ebullition of my own blood, that she ought this</p><p>
outrageous affirmation of what struck me as the intensity of masculine</p><p>
egotism.  It centred everything in itself, and deprived woman of her</p><p>
very soul, her inexpressible and unfathomable all, to make it a mere</p><p>
incident in the great sum of man.  Hollingsworth had boldly uttered</p><p>
what he, and millions of despots like him, really felt. Without</p><p>
intending it, he had disclosed the wellspring of all these troubled</p><p>
waters.  Now, if ever, it surely behooved Zenobia to be the champion of</p><p>
her sex.</p>
<p>
But, to my surprise, and indignation too, she only looked humbled. Some</p><p>
tears sparkled in her eyes, but they were wholly of grief, not anger.</p>
<p>
"Well, be it so," was all she said.  "I, at least, have deep cause to</p><p>
think you right.  Let man be but manly and godlike, and woman is only</p><p>
too ready to become to him what you say!"</p>
<p>
I smiled--somewhat bitterly, it is true--in contemplation of my own</p><p>
ill-luck.  How little did these two women care for me, who had freely</p><p>
conceded all their claims, and a great deal more, out of the fulness of</p><p>
my heart; while Hollingsworth, by some necromancy of his horrible</p><p>
injustice, seemed to have brought them both to his feet!</p>
<p>
"Women almost invariably behave thus," thought I. "What does the fact</p><p>
mean?  Is it their nature?  Or is it, at last, the result of ages of</p><p>
compelled degradation?  And, in either case, will it be possible ever</p><p>
to redeem them?"</p>
<p>
An intuition now appeared to possess all the party, that, for this</p><p>
time, at least, there was no more to be said.  With one accord, we</p><p>
arose from the ground, and made our way through the tangled undergrowth</p><p>
towards one of those pleasant wood-paths that wound among the</p><p>
overarching trees.  Some of the branches hung so low as partly to</p><p>
conceal the figures that went before from those who followed. Priscilla</p><p>
had leaped up more lightly than the rest of us, and ran along in</p><p>
advance, with as much airy activity of spirit as was typified in the</p><p>
motion of a bird, which chanced to be flitting from tree to tree, in</p><p>
the same direction as herself.  Never did she seem so happy as that</p><p>
afternoon.  She skipt, and could not help it, from very playfulness of</p><p>
heart.</p>
<p>
Zenobia and Hollingsworth went next, in close contiguity, but not with</p><p>
arm in arm.  Now, just when they had passed the impending bough of a</p><p>
birch-tree, I plainly saw Zenobia take the hand of Hollingsworth in</p><p>
both her own, press it to her bosom, and let it fall again!</p>
<p>
The gesture was sudden, and full of passion; the impulse had evidently</p><p>
taken her by surprise; it expressed all!  Had Zenobia knelt before him,</p><p>
or flung herself upon his breast, and gasped out, "I love you,</p><p>
Hollingsworth!"  I could not have been more certain of what it meant.</p><p>
They then walked onward, as before.  But, methought, as the declining</p><p>
sun threw Zenobia's magnified shadow along the path, I beheld it</p><p>
tremulous; and the delicate stem of the flower which she wore in her</p><p>
hair was likewise responsive to her agitation.</p>
<p>
Priscilla--through the medium of her eyes, at least could not possibly</p><p>
have been aware of the gesture above described.  Yet, at that instant,</p><p>
I saw her droop.  The buoyancy, which just before had been so</p><p>
bird-like, was utterly departed; the life seemed to pass out of her,</p><p>
and even the substance of her figure to grow thin and gray. I almost</p><p>
imagined her a shadow, tiding gradually into the dimness of the wood.</p><p>
Her pace became so slow that Hollingsworth and Zenobia passed by, and</p><p>
I, without hastening my footsteps, overtook her.</p>
<p>
"Come, Priscilla," said I, looking her intently in the face, which was</p><p>
very pale and sorrowful, "we must make haste after our friends. Do you</p><p>
feel suddenly ill?  A moment ago, you flitted along so lightly that I</p><p>
was comparing you to a bird.  Now, on the contrary, it is as if you had</p><p>
a heavy heart, and a very little strength to bear it with. Pray take my</p><p>
arm!"</p>
<p>
"No," said Priscilla, "I do not think it would help me.  It is my</p><p>
heart, as you say, that makes me heavy; and I know not why.  Just now,</p><p>
I felt very happy."</p>
<p>
No doubt it was a kind of sacrilege in me to attempt to come within her</p><p>
maidenly mystery; but, as she appeared to be tossed aside by her other</p><p>
friends, or carelessly let fall, like a flower which they had done</p><p>
with, I could not resist the impulse to take just one peep beneath her</p><p>
folded petals.</p>
<p>
"Zenobia and yourself are dear friends of late," I remarked.  "At</p><p>
first,--that first evening when you came to us,--she did not receive</p><p>
you quite so warmly as might have been wished."</p>
<p>
"I remember it," said Priscilla.  "No wonder she hesitated to love me,</p><p>
who was then a stranger to her, and a girl of no grace or beauty,--she</p><p>
being herself so beautiful!"</p>
<p>
"But she loves you now, of course?" suggested I. "And at this very</p><p>
instant you feel her to be your dearest friend?"</p>
<p>
"Why do you ask me that question?" exclaimed Priscilla, as if</p><p>
frightened at the scrutiny into her feelings which I compelled her to</p><p>
make.  "It somehow puts strange thoughts into my mind.  But I do love</p><p>
Zenobia dearly!  If she only loves me half as well, I shall be happy!"</p>
<p>
"How is it possible to doubt that, Priscilla?"  I rejoined.  "But</p><p>
observe how pleasantly and happily Zenobia and Hollingsworth are</p><p>
walking together.  I call it a delightful spectacle.  It truly rejoices</p><p>
me that Hollingsworth has found so fit and affectionate a friend!  So</p><p>
many people in the world mistrust him,--so many disbelieve and</p><p>
ridicule, while hardly any do him justice, or acknowledge him for the</p><p>
wonderful man he is,--that it is really a blessed thing for him to have</p><p>
won the sympathy of such a woman as Zenobia.  Any man might be proud of</p><p>
that.  Any man, even if he be as great as Hollingsworth, might love so</p><p>
magnificent a woman.  How very beautiful Zenobia is!  And Hollingsworth</p><p>
knows it, too."</p>
<p>
There may have been some petty malice in what I said.  Generosity is a</p><p>
very fine thing, at a proper time and within due limits.  But it is an</p><p>
insufferable bore to see one man engrossing every thought of all the</p><p>
women, and leaving his friend to shiver in outer seclusion, without</p><p>
even the alternative of solacing himself with what the more fortunate</p><p>
individual has rejected.  Yes, it was out of a foolish bitterness of</p><p>
heart that I had spoken.</p>
<p>
"Go on before," said Priscilla abruptly, and with true feminine</p><p>
imperiousness, which heretofore I had never seen her exercise.  "It</p><p>
pleases me best to loiter along by myself.  I do not walk so fast as</p><p>
you."</p>
<p>
With her hand she made a little gesture of dismissal.  It provoked me;</p><p>
yet, on the whole, was the most bewitching thing that Priscilla had</p><p>
ever done.  I obeyed her, and strolled moodily homeward, wondering--as</p><p>
I had wondered a thousand times already--how Hollingsworth meant to</p><p>
dispose of these two hearts, which (plainly to my perception, and, as I</p><p>
could not but now suppose, to his) he had engrossed into his own huge</p><p>
egotism.</p>
<p>
There was likewise another subject hardly less fruitful of speculation.</p><p>
In what attitude did Zenobia present herself to Hollingsworth?  Was it</p><p>
in that of a free woman, with no mortgage on her affections nor</p><p>
claimant to her hand, but fully at liberty to surrender both, in</p><p>
exchange for the heart and hand which she apparently expected to</p><p>
receive?  But was it a vision that I had witnessed in the wood?  Was</p><p>
Westervelt a goblin?  Were those words of passion and agony, which</p><p>
Zenobia had uttered in my hearing, a mere stage declamation?  Were they</p><p>
formed of a material lighter than common air?  Or, supposing them to</p><p>
bear sterling weight, was it a perilous and dreadful wrong which she</p><p>
was meditating towards herself and Hollingsworth?</p>
<p>
Arriving nearly at the farmhouse, I looked back over the long slope of</p><p>
pasture land, and beheld them standing together, in the light of</p><p>
sunset, just on the spot where, according to the gossip of the</p><p>
Community, they meant to build their cottage.  Priscilla, alone and</p><p>
forgotten, was lingering in the shadow of the wood.</p>
<p>
XV. A CRISIS</p>
<p>
Thus the summer was passing away,--a summer of toil, of interest, of</p><p>
something that was not pleasure, but which went deep into my heart, and</p><p>
there became a rich experience.  I found myself looking forward to</p><p>
years, if not to a lifetime, to be spent on the same system.  The</p><p>
Community were now beginning to form their permanent plans.  One of our</p><p>
purposes was to erect a Phalanstery (as I think we called it, after</p><p>
Fourier; but the phraseology of those days is not very fresh in my</p><p>
remembrance), where the great and general family should have its</p><p>
abiding-place.  Individual members, too, who made it a point of</p><p>
religion to preserve the sanctity of an exclusive home, were selecting</p><p>
sites for their cottages, by the wood-side, or on the breezy swells, or</p><p>
in the sheltered nook of some little valley, according as their taste</p><p>
might lean towards snugness or the picturesque.  Altogether, by</p><p>
projecting our minds outward, we had imparted a show of novelty to</p><p>
existence, and contemplated it as hopefully as if the soil beneath our</p><p>
feet had not been fathom-deep with the dust of deluded generations, on</p><p>
every one of which, as on ourselves, the world had imposed itself as a</p><p>
hitherto unwedded bride.</p>
<p>
Hollingsworth and myself had often discussed these prospects.  It was</p><p>
easy to perceive, however, that he spoke with little or no fervor, but</p><p>
either as questioning the fulfilment of our anticipations, or, at any</p><p>
rate, with a quiet consciousness that it was no personal concern of</p><p>
his.  Shortly after the scene at Eliot's pulpit, while he and I were</p><p>
repairing an old stone fence, I amused myself with sallying forward</p><p>
into the future time.</p>
<p>
"When we come to be old men," I said, "they will call us uncles, or</p><p>
fathers,--Father Hollingsworth and Uncle Coverdale,--and we will look</p><p>
back cheerfully to these early days, and make a romantic story for the</p><p>
young People (and if a little more romantic than truth may warrant, it</p><p>
will be no harm) out of our severe trials and hardships. In a century</p><p>
or two, we shall, every one of us, be mythical personages, or</p><p>
exceedingly picturesque and poetical ones, at all events.  They will</p><p>
have a great public hall, in which your portrait, and mine, and twenty</p><p>
other faces that are living now, shall be hung up; and as for me, I</p><p>
will be painted in my shirtsleeves, and with the sleeves rolled up, to</p><p>
show my muscular development.  What stories will be rife among them</p><p>
about our mighty strength!" continued I, lifting a big stone and</p><p>
putting it into its place, "though our posterity will really be far</p><p>
stronger than ourselves, after several generations of a simple,</p><p>
natural, and active life.  What legends of Zenobia's beauty, and</p><p>
Priscilla's slender and shadowy grace, and those mysterious qualities</p><p>
which make her seem diaphanous with spiritual light!  In due course of</p><p>
ages, we must all figure heroically in an epic poem; and we will</p><p>
ourselves--at least, I will--bend unseen over the future poet, and lend</p><p>
him inspiration while he writes it."</p>
<p>
"You seem," said Hollingsworth, "to be trying how much nonsense you can</p><p>
pour out in a breath."</p>
<p>
"I wish you would see fit to comprehend," retorted I, "that the</p><p>
profoundest wisdom must be mingled with nine tenths of nonsense, else</p><p>
it is not worth the breath that utters it.  But I do long for the</p><p>
cottages to be built, that the creeping plants may begin to run over</p><p>
them, and the moss to gather on the walls, and the trees--which we will</p><p>
set out--to cover them with a breadth of shadow.  This spick-and-span</p><p>
novelty does not quite suit my taste.  It is time, too, for children to</p><p>
be born among us.  The first-born child is still to come.  And I shall</p><p>
never feel as if this were a real, practical, as well as poetical</p><p>
system of human life, until somebody has sanctified it by death."</p>
<p>
"A pretty occasion for martyrdom, truly!" said Hollingsworth.</p>
<p>
"As good as any other," I replied.  "I wonder, Hollingsworth, who, of</p><p>
all these strong men, and fair women and maidens, is doomed the first</p><p>
to die.  Would it not be well, even before we have absolute need of it,</p><p>
to fix upon a spot for a cemetery?  Let us choose the rudest, roughest,</p><p>
most uncultivable spot, for Death's garden ground; and Death shall</p><p>
teach us to beautify it, grave by grave.  By our sweet, calm way of</p><p>
dying, and the airy elegance out of which we will shape our funeral</p><p>
rites, and the cheerful allegories which we will model into tombstones,</p><p>
the final scene shall lose its terrors; so that hereafter it may be</p><p>
happiness to live, and bliss to die.  None of us must die young.  Yet,</p><p>
should Providence ordain it so, the event shall not be sorrowful, but</p><p>
affect us with a tender, delicious, only half-melancholy, and almost</p><p>
smiling pathos!"</p>
<p>
"That is to say," muttered Hollingsworth, "you will die like a heathen,</p><p>
as you certainly live like one.  But, listen to me, Coverdale.  Your</p><p>
fantastic anticipations make me discern all the more forcibly what a</p><p>
wretched, unsubstantial scheme is this, on which we have wasted a</p><p>
precious summer of our lives.  Do you seriously imagine that any such</p><p>
realities as you, and many others here, have dreamed of, will ever be</p><p>
brought to pass?"</p>
<p>
"Certainly I do," said I. "Of course, when the reality comes, it will</p><p>
wear the every-day, commonplace, dusty, and rather homely garb that</p><p>
reality always does put on.  But, setting aside the ideal charm, I hold</p><p>
that our highest anticipations have a solid footing on common sense."</p>
<p>
"You only half believe what you say," rejoined Hollingsworth; "and as</p><p>
for me, I neither have faith in your dream, nor would care the value of</p><p>
this pebble for its realization, were that possible.  And what more do</p><p>
you want of it?  It has given you a theme for poetry.  Let that content</p><p>
you.  But now I ask you to be, at last, a man of sobriety and</p><p>
earnestness, and aid me in an enterprise which is worth all our</p><p>
strength, and the strength of a thousand mightier than we."</p>
<p>
There can be no need of giving in detail the conversation that ensued.</p><p>
It is enough to say that Hollingsworth once more brought forward his</p><p>
rigid and unconquerable idea,--a scheme for the reformation of the</p><p>
wicked by methods moral, intellectual, and industrial, by the sympathy</p><p>
of pure, humble, and yet exalted minds, and by opening to his pupils</p><p>
the possibility of a worthier life than that which had become their</p><p>
fate.  It appeared, unless he overestimated his own means, that</p><p>
Hollingsworth held it at his choice (and he did so choose) to obtain</p><p>
possession of the very ground on which we had planted our Community,</p><p>
and which had not yet been made irrevocably ours, by purchase.  It was</p><p>
just the foundation that he desired.  Our beginnings might readily be</p><p>
adapted to his great end.  The arrangements already completed would</p><p>
work quietly into his system. So plausible looked his theory, and, more</p><p>
than that, so practical,--such an air of reasonableness had he, by</p><p>
patient thought, thrown over it,--each segment of it was contrived to</p><p>
dovetail into all the rest with such a complicated applicability, and</p><p>
so ready was he with a response for every objection, that, really, so</p><p>
far as logic and argument went, he had the matter all his own way.</p>
<p>
"But," said I, "whence can you, having no means of your own, derive the</p><p>
enormous capital which is essential to this experiment?  State Street,</p><p>
I imagine, would not draw its purser strings very liberally in aid of</p><p>
such a speculation."</p>
<p>
"I have the funds--as much, at least, as is needed for a</p><p>
commencement--at command," he answered.  "They can be produced within a</p><p>
month, if necessary."</p>
<p>
My thoughts reverted to Zenobia.  It could only be her wealth which</p><p>
Hollingsworth was appropriating so lavishly.  And on what conditions</p><p>
was it to be had?  Did she fling it into the scheme with the</p><p>
uncalculating generosity that characterizes a woman when it is her</p><p>
impulse to be generous at all?  And did she fling herself along with</p><p>
it?  But Hollingsworth did not volunteer an explanation.</p>
<p>
"And have you no regrets," I inquired, "in overthrowing this fair</p><p>
system of our new life, which has been planned so deeply, and is now</p><p>
beginning to flourish so hopefully around us?  How beautiful it is,</p><p>
and, so far as we can yet see, how practicable!  The ages have waited</p><p>
for us, and here we are, the very first that have essayed to carry on</p><p>
our mortal existence in love and mutual help!  Hollingsworth, I would</p><p>
be loath to take the ruin of this enterprise upon my conscience."</p>
<p>
"Then let it rest wholly upon mine!" he answered, knitting his black</p><p>
brows.  "I see through the system.  It is full of</p><p>
defects,--irremediable and damning ones!--from first to last, there is</p><p>
nothing else!  I grasp it in my hand, and find no substance whatever.</p><p>
There is not human nature in it."</p>
<p>
"Why are you so secret in your operations?"  I asked.  "God forbid that</p><p>
I should accuse you of intentional wrong; but the besetting sin of a</p><p>
philanthropist, it appears to me, is apt to be a moral obliquity. His</p><p>
sense of honor ceases to be the sense of other honorable men. At some</p><p>
point of his course--I know not exactly when or where--he is tempted to</p><p>
palter with the right, and can scarcely forbear persuading himself that</p><p>
the importance of his public ends renders it allowable to throw aside</p><p>
his private conscience.  Oh, my dear friend, beware this error!  If you</p><p>
meditate the overthrow of this establishment, call together our</p><p>
companions, state your design, support it with all your eloquence, but</p><p>
allow them an opportunity of defending themselves."</p>
<p>
"It does not suit me," said Hollingsworth.  "Nor is it my duty to do</p><p>
so."</p>
<p>
"I think it is," replied I.</p>
<p>
Hollingsworth frowned; not in passion, but, like fate, inexorably.</p>
<p>
"I will not argue the point," said he.  "What I desire to know of you</p><p>
is,--and you can tell me in one word,--whether I am to look for your</p><p>
cooperation in this great scheme of good?  Take it up with me!  Be my</p><p>
brother in it!  It offers you (what you have told me, over and over</p><p>
again, that you most need) a purpose in life, worthy of the extremest</p><p>
self-devotion,--worthy of martyrdom, should God so order it!  In this</p><p>
view, I present it to you.  You can greatly benefit mankind.  Your</p><p>
peculiar faculties, as I shall direct them, are capable of being so</p><p>
wrought into this enterprise that not one of them need lie idle. Strike</p><p>
hands with me, and from this moment you shall never again feel the</p><p>
languor and vague wretchedness of an indolent or half-occupied man.</p><p>
There may be no more aimless beauty in your life; but, in its stead,</p><p>
there shall be strength, courage, immitigable will,--everything that a</p><p>
manly and generous nature should desire!  We shall succeed!  We shall</p><p>
have done our best for this miserable world; and happiness (which never</p><p>
comes but incidentally) will come to us unawares."</p>
<p>
It seemed his intention to say no more.  But, after he had quite broken</p><p>
off, his deep eyes filled with tears, and he held out both his hands to</p><p>
me.</p>
<p>
"Coverdale," he murmured, "there is not the man in this wide world whom</p><p>
I can love as I could you.  Do not forsake me!"</p>
<p>
As I look back upon this scene, through the coldness and dimness of so</p><p>
many years, there is still a sensation as if Hollingsworth had caught</p><p>
hold of my heart, and were pulling it towards him with an almost</p><p>
irresistible force.  It is a mystery to me how I withstood it. But, in</p><p>
truth, I saw in his scheme of philanthropy nothing but what was odious.</p><p>
A loathsomeness that was to be forever in my daily work! A great black</p><p>
ugliness of sin, which he proposed to collect out of a thousand human</p><p>
hearts, and that we should spend our lives in an experiment of</p><p>
transmuting it into virtue!  Had I but touched his extended hand,</p><p>
Hollingsworth's magnetism would perhaps have penetrated me with his own</p><p>
conception of all these matters.  But I stood aloof.  I fortified</p><p>
myself with doubts whether his strength of purpose had not been too</p><p>
gigantic for his integrity, impelling him to trample on considerations</p><p>
that should have been paramount to every other.</p>
<p>
"Is Zenobia to take a part in your enterprise?"  I asked.</p>
<p>
"She is," said Hollingsworth.</p>
<p>
"She!--the beautiful!--the gorgeous!"  I exclaimed.  "And how have you</p><p>
prevailed with such a woman to work in this squalid element?"</p>
<p>
"Through no base methods, as you seem to suspect," he answered; "but by</p><p>
addressing whatever is best and noblest in her."</p>
<p>
Hollingsworth was looking on the ground.  But, as he often did</p><p>
so,--generally, indeed, in his habitual moods of thought,--I could not</p><p>
judge whether it was from any special unwillingness now to meet my</p><p>
eyes.  What it was that dictated my next question, I cannot precisely</p><p>
say.  Nevertheless, it rose so inevitably into my mouth, and, as it</p><p>
were, asked itself so involuntarily, that there must needs have been an</p><p>
aptness in it.</p>
<p>
"What is to become of Priscilla?"</p>
<p>
Hollingsworth looked at me fiercely, and with glowing eyes.  He could</p><p>
not have shown any other kind of expression than that, had he meant to</p><p>
strike me with a sword.</p>
<p>
"Why do you bring in the names of these women?" said he, after a moment</p><p>
of pregnant silence.  "What have they to do with the proposal which I</p><p>
make you?  I must have your answer!  Will you devote yourself, and</p><p>
sacrifice all to this great end, and be my friend of friends forever?"</p>
<p>
"In Heaven's name, Hollingsworth," cried I, getting angry, and glad to</p><p>
be angry, because so only was it possible to oppose his tremendous</p><p>
concentrativeness and indomitable will, "cannot you conceive that a man</p><p>
may wish well to the world, and struggle for its good, on some other</p><p>
plan than precisely that which you have laid down?  And will you cast</p><p>
off a friend for no unworthiness, but merely because he stands upon his</p><p>
right as an individual being, and looks at matters through his own</p><p>
optics, instead of yours?"</p>
<p>
"Be with me," said Hollingsworth, "or be against me!  There is no third</p><p>
choice for you."</p>
<p>
"Take this, then, as my decision," I answered.  "I doubt the wisdom of</p><p>
your scheme.  Furthermore, I greatly fear that the methods by which you</p><p>
allow yourself to pursue it are such as cannot stand the scrutiny of an</p><p>
unbiassed conscience."</p>
<p>
"And you will not join me?"</p>
<p>
"No!"</p>
<p>
I never said the word--and certainly can never have it to say</p><p>
hereafter--that cost me a thousandth part so hard an effort as did that</p><p>
one syllable.  The heart-pang was not merely figurative, but an</p><p>
absolute torture of the breast.  I was gazing steadfastly at</p><p>
Hollingsworth.  It seemed to me that it struck him, too, like a bullet.</p><p>
A ghastly paleness--always so terrific on a swarthy face--overspread</p><p>
his features.  There was a convulsive movement of his throat, as if he</p><p>
were forcing down some words that struggled and fought for utterance.</p><p>
Whether words of anger, or words of grief, I cannot tell; although many</p><p>
and many a time I have vainly tormented myself with conjecturing which</p><p>
of the two they were.  One other appeal to my friendship,--such as</p><p>
once, already, Hollingsworth had made,--taking me in the revulsion that</p><p>
followed a strenuous exercise of opposing will, would completely have</p><p>
subdued me.  But he left the matter there.  "Well!" said he.</p>
<p>
And that was all!  I should have been thankful for one word more, even</p><p>
had it shot me through the heart, as mine did him.  But he did not</p><p>
speak it; and, after a few moments, with one accord, we set to work</p><p>
again, repairing the stone fence.  Hollingsworth, I observed, wrought</p><p>
like a Titan; and, for my own part, I lifted stones which at this</p><p>
day--or, in a calmer mood, at that one--I should no more have thought</p><p>
it possible to stir than to carry off the gates of Gaza on my back.</p>
<p>
XVI. LEAVE-TAKINGS</p>
<p>
A few days after the tragic passage-at-arms between Hollingsworth and</p><p>
me, I appeared at the dinner-table actually dressed in a coat, instead</p><p>
of my customary blouse; with a satin cravat, too, a white vest, and</p><p>
several other things that made me seem strange and outlandish to</p><p>
myself.  As for my companions, this unwonted spectacle caused a great</p><p>
stir upon the wooden benches that bordered either side of our homely</p><p>
board.</p>
<p>
"What's in the wind now, Miles?" asked one of them.  "Are you deserting</p><p>
us?"</p>
<p>
"Yes, for a week or two," said I. "It strikes me that my health demands</p><p>
a little relaxation of labor, and a short visit to the seaside, during</p><p>
the dog-days."</p>
<p>
"You look like it!" grumbled Silas Foster, not greatly pleased with the</p><p>
idea of losing an efficient laborer before the stress of the season was</p><p>
well over.  "Now, here's a pretty fellow!  His shoulders have broadened</p><p>
a matter of six inches since he came among us; he can do his day's</p><p>
work, if he likes, with any man or ox on the farm; and yet he talks</p><p>
about going to the seashore for his health!  Well, well, old woman,"</p><p>
added he to his wife, "let me have a plateful of that pork and cabbage!</p><p>
I begin to feel in a very weakly way.  When the others have had their</p><p>
turn, you and I will take a jaunt to Newport or Saratoga!"</p>
<p>
"Well, but, Mr. Foster," said I, "you must allow me to take a little</p><p>
breath."</p>
<p>
"Breath!" retorted the old yeoman.  "Your lungs have the play of a pair</p><p>
of blacksmith's bellows already.  What on earth do you want more?  But</p><p>
go along!  I understand the business.  We shall never see your face</p><p>
here again.  Here ends the reformation of the world, so far as Miles</p><p>
Coverdale has a hand in it!"</p>
<p>
"By no means," I replied.  "I am resolute to die in the last ditch, for</p><p>
the good of the cause."</p>
<p>
"Die in a ditch!" muttered gruff Silas, with genuine Yankee intolerance</p><p>
of any intermission of toil, except on Sunday, the Fourth of July, the</p><p>
autumnal cattle-show, Thanksgiving, or the annual Fast,--"die in a</p><p>
ditch!  I believe, in my conscience, you would, if there were no</p><p>
steadier means than your own labor to keep you out of it!"</p>
<p>
The truth was, that an intolerable discontent and irksomeness had come</p><p>
over me.  Blithedale was no longer what it had been.  Everything was</p><p>
suddenly faded.  The sunburnt and arid aspect of our woods and</p><p>
pastures, beneath the August sky, did but imperfectly symbolize the</p><p>
lack of dew and moisture, that, since yesterday, as it were, had</p><p>
blighted my fields of thought, and penetrated to the innermost and</p><p>
shadiest of my contemplative recesses.  The change will be recognized</p><p>
by many, who, after a period of happiness, have endeavored to go on</p><p>
with the same kind of life, in the same scene, in spite of the</p><p>
alteration or withdrawal of some principal circumstance.  They discover</p><p>
(what heretofore, perhaps, they had not known) that it was this which</p><p>
gave the bright color and vivid reality to the whole affair.</p>
<p>
I stood on other terms than before, not only with Hollingsworth, but</p><p>
with Zenobia and Priscilla.  As regarded the two latter, it was that</p><p>
dreamlike and miserable sort of change that denies you the privilege to</p><p>
complain, because you can assert no positive injury, nor lay your</p><p>
finger on anything tangible.  It is a matter which you do not see, but</p><p>
feel, and which, when you try to analyze it, seems to lose its very</p><p>
existence, and resolve itself into a sickly humor of your own. Your</p><p>
understanding, possibly, may put faith in this denial.  But your heart</p><p>
will not so easily rest satisfied.  It incessantly remonstrates,</p><p>
though, most of the time, in a bass-note, which you do not separately</p><p>
distinguish; but, now and then, with a sharp cry, importunate to be</p><p>
heard, and resolute to claim belief.  "Things are not as they were!" it</p><p>
keeps saying.  "You shall not impose on me!  I will never be quiet!  I</p><p>
will throb painfully!  I will be heavy, and desolate, and shiver with</p><p>
cold!  For I, your deep heart, know when to be miserable, as once I</p><p>
knew when to be happy!  All is changed for us! You are beloved no</p><p>
more!"  And were my life to be spent over again, I would invariably</p><p>
lend my ear to this Cassandra of the inward depths, however clamorous</p><p>
the music and the merriment of a more superficial region.</p>
<p>
My outbreak with Hollingsworth, though never definitely known to our</p><p>
associates, had really an effect upon the moral atmosphere of the</p><p>
Community.  It was incidental to the closeness of relationship into</p><p>
which we had brought ourselves, that an unfriendly state of feeling</p><p>
could not occur between any two members without the whole society being</p><p>
more or less commoted and made uncomfortable thereby.  This species of</p><p>
nervous sympathy (though a pretty characteristic enough, sentimentally</p><p>
considered, and apparently betokening an actual bond of love among us)</p><p>
was yet found rather inconvenient in its practical operation, mortal</p><p>
tempers being so infirm and variable as they are. If one of us happened</p><p>
to give his neighbor a box on the ear, the tingle was immediately felt</p><p>
on the same side of everybody's head. Thus, even on the supposition</p><p>
that we were far less quarrelsome than the rest of the world, a great</p><p>
deal of time was necessarily wasted in rubbing our ears.</p>
<p>
Musing on all these matters, I felt an inexpressible longing for at</p><p>
least a temporary novelty.  I thought of going across the Rocky</p><p>
Mountains, or to Europe, or up the Nile; of offering myself a volunteer</p><p>
on the Exploring Expedition; of taking a ramble of years, no matter in</p><p>
what direction, and coming back on the other side of the world.  Then,</p><p>
should the colonists of Blithedale have established their enterprise on</p><p>
a permanent basis, I might fling aside my pilgrim staff and dusty</p><p>
shoon, and rest as peacefully here as elsewhere.  Or, in case</p><p>
Hollingsworth should occupy the ground with his School of Reform, as he</p><p>
now purposed, I might plead earthly guilt enough, by that time, to give</p><p>
me what I was inclined to think the only trustworthy hold on his</p><p>
affections.  Meanwhile, before deciding on any ultimate plan, I</p><p>
determined to remove myself to a little distance, and take an exterior</p><p>
view of what we had all been about.</p>
<p>
In truth, it was dizzy work, amid such fermentation of opinions as was</p><p>
going on in the general brain of the Community.  It was a kind of</p><p>
Bedlam, for the time being, although out of the very thoughts that were</p><p>
wildest and most destructive might grow a wisdom, holy, calm, and pure,</p><p>
and that should incarnate itself with the substance of a noble and</p><p>
happy life.  But, as matters now were, I felt myself (and, having a</p><p>
decided tendency towards the actual, I never liked to feel it) getting</p><p>
quite out of my reckoning, with regard to the existing state of the</p><p>
world.  I was beginning to lose the sense of what kind of a world it</p><p>
was, among innumerable schemes of what it might or ought to be.  It was</p><p>
impossible, situated as we were, not to imbibe the idea that everything</p><p>
in nature and human existence was fluid, or fast becoming so; that the</p><p>
crust of the earth in many places was broken, and its whole surface</p><p>
portentously upheaving; that it was a day of crisis, and that we</p><p>
ourselves were in the critical vortex. Our great globe floated in the</p><p>
atmosphere of infinite space like an unsubstantial bubble.  No</p><p>
sagacious man will long retain his sagacity, if he live exclusively</p><p>
among reformers and progressive people, without periodically returning</p><p>
into the settled system of things, to correct himself by a new</p><p>
observation from that old standpoint.</p>
<p>
It was now time for me, therefore, to go and hold a little talk with</p><p>
the conservatives, the writers of "The North American Review," the</p><p>
merchants, the politicians, the Cambridge men, and all those</p><p>
respectable old blockheads who still, in this intangibility and</p><p>
mistiness of affairs, kept a death-grip on one or two ideas which had</p><p>
not come into vogue since yesterday morning.</p>
<p>
The brethren took leave of me with cordial kindness; and as for the</p><p>
sisterhood, I had serious thoughts of kissing them all round, but</p><p>
forbore to do so, because, in all such general salutations, the penance</p><p>
is fully equal to the pleasure.  So I kissed none of them; and nobody,</p><p>
to say the truth, seemed to expect it.</p>
<p>
"Do you wish me," I said to Zenobia, "to announce in town, and at the</p><p>
watering-places, your purpose to deliver a course of lectures on the</p><p>
rights of women?"</p>
<p>
"Women possess no rights," said Zenobia, with a half-melancholy smile;</p><p>
"or, at all events, only little girls and grandmothers would have the</p><p>
force to exercise them."</p>
<p>
She gave me her hand freely and kindly, and looked at me, I thought,</p><p>
with a pitying expression in her eyes; nor was there any settled light</p><p>
of joy in them on her own behalf, but a troubled and passionate flame,</p><p>
flickering and fitful.</p>
<p>
"I regret, on the whole, that you are leaving us," she said; "and all</p><p>
the more, since I feel that this phase of our life is finished, and can</p><p>
never be lived over again.  Do you know, Mr. Coverdale, that I have</p><p>
been several times on the point of making you my confidant, for lack of</p><p>
a better and wiser one?  But you are too young to be my father</p><p>
confessor; and you would not thank me for treating you like one of</p><p>
those good little handmaidens who share the bosom secrets of a</p><p>
tragedy-queen."</p>
<p>
"I would, at least, be loyal and faithful," answered I; "and would</p><p>
counsel you with an honest purpose, if not wisely."</p>
<p>
"Yes," said Zenobia, "you would be only too wise, too honest. Honesty</p><p>
and wisdom are such a delightful pastime, at another person's expense!"</p>
<p>
"Ah, Zenobia," I exclaimed, "if you would but let me speak!"</p>
<p>
"By no means," she replied, "especially when you have just resumed the</p><p>
whole series of social conventionalisms, together with that</p><p>
strait-bodied coat.  I would as lief open my heart to a lawyer or a</p><p>
clergyman!  No, no, Mr. Coverdale; if I choose a counsellor, in the</p><p>
present aspect of my affairs, it must be either an angel or a madman;</p><p>
and I rather apprehend that the latter would be likeliest of the two to</p><p>
speak the fitting word.  It needs a wild steersman when we voyage</p><p>
through chaos!  The anchor is up,--farewell!"</p>
<p>
Priscilla, as soon as dinner was over, had betaken herself into a</p><p>
corner, and set to work on a little purse.  As I approached her, she</p><p>
let her eyes rest on me with a calm, serious look; for, with all her</p><p>
delicacy of nerves, there was a singular self-possession in Priscilla,</p><p>
and her sensibilities seemed to lie sheltered from ordinary commotion,</p><p>
like the water in a deep well.</p>
<p>
"Will you give me that purse, Priscilla," said I, "as a parting</p><p>
keepsake?"</p>
<p>
"Yes," she answered, "if you will wait till it is finished."</p>
<p>
"I must not wait, even for that," I replied.  "Shall I find you here,</p><p>
on my return?"</p>
<p>
"I never wish to go away," said she.</p>
<p>
"I have sometimes thought," observed I, smiling, "that you, Priscilla,</p><p>
are a little prophetess, or, at least, that you have spiritual</p><p>
intimations respecting matters which are dark to us grosser people. If</p><p>
that be the case, I should like to ask you what is about to happen; for</p><p>
I am tormented with a strong foreboding that, were I to return even so</p><p>
soon as to-morrow morning, I should find everything changed. Have you</p><p>
any impressions of this nature?"</p>
<p>
"Ah, no," said Priscilla, looking at me apprehensively.  "If any such</p><p>
misfortune is coming, the shadow has not reached me yet.  Heaven</p><p>
forbid!  I should be glad if there might never be any change, but one</p><p>
summer follow another, and all just like this."</p>
<p>
"No summer ever came back, and no two summers ever were alike," said I,</p><p>
with a degree of Orphic wisdom that astonished myself.  "Times change,</p><p>
and people change; and if our hearts do not change as readily, so much</p><p>
the worse for us.  Good-by, Priscilla!"</p>
<p>
I gave her hand a pressure, which, I think, she neither resisted nor</p><p>
returned.  Priscilla's heart was deep, but of small compass; it had</p><p>
room but for a very few dearest ones, among whom she never reckoned me.</p>
<p>
On the doorstep I met Hollingsworth.  I had a momentary impulse to hold</p><p>
out my hand, or at least to give a parting nod, but resisted both.</p><p>
When a real and strong affection has come to an end, it is not well to</p><p>
mock the sacred past with any show of those commonplace civilities that</p><p>
belong to ordinary intercourse.  Being dead henceforth to him, and he</p><p>
to me, there could be no propriety in our chilling one another with the</p><p>
touch of two corpse-like hands, or playing at looks of courtesy with</p><p>
eyes that were impenetrable beneath the glaze and the film.  We passed,</p><p>
therefore, as if mutually invisible.</p>
<p>
I can nowise explain what sort of whim, prank, or perversity it was,</p><p>
that, after all these leave-takings, induced me to go to the pigsty,</p><p>
and take leave of the swine!  There they lay, buried as deeply among</p><p>
the straw as they could burrow, four huge black grunters, the very</p><p>
symbols of slothful ease and sensual comfort.  They were asleep,</p><p>
drawing short and heavy breaths, which heaved their big sides up and</p><p>
down.  Unclosing their eyes, however, at my approach, they looked dimly</p><p>
forth at the outer world, and simultaneously uttered a gentle grunt;</p><p>
not putting themselves to the trouble of an additional breath for that</p><p>
particular purpose, but grunting with their ordinary inhalation.  They</p><p>
were involved, and almost stifled and buried alive, in their own</p><p>
corporeal substance.  The very unreadiness and oppression wherewith</p><p>
these greasy citizens gained breath enough to keep their life-machinery</p><p>
in sluggish movement appeared to make them only the more sensible of</p><p>
the ponderous and fat satisfaction of their existence.  Peeping at me</p><p>
an instant out of their small, red, hardly perceptible eyes, they dropt</p><p>
asleep again; yet not so far asleep but that their unctuous bliss was</p><p>
still present to them, betwixt dream and reality.</p>
<p>
"You must come back in season to eat part of a spare-rib," said Silas</p><p>
Foster, giving my hand a mighty squeeze.  "I shall have these fat</p><p>
fellows hanging up by the heels, heads downward, pretty soon, I tell</p><p>
you!"</p>
<p>
"O cruel Silas, what a horrible idea!" cried I. "All the rest of us,</p><p>
men, women, and livestock, save only these four porkers, are bedevilled</p><p>
with one grief or another; they alone are happy,--and you mean to cut</p><p>
their throats and eat them!  It would be more for the general comfort</p><p>
to let them eat us; and bitter and sour morsels we should be!"</p>
<p>
XVII. THE HOTEL</p>
<p>
Arriving in town (where my bachelor-rooms, long before this time, had</p><p>
received some other occupant), I established myself, for a day or two,</p><p>
in a certain, respectable hotel.  It was situated somewhat aloof from</p><p>
my former track in life; my present mood inclining me to avoid most of</p><p>
my old companions, from whom I was now sundered by other interests, and</p><p>
who would have been likely enough to amuse themselves at the expense of</p><p>
the amateur workingman.  The hotel-keeper put me into a back room of</p><p>
the third story of his spacious establishment. The day was lowering,</p><p>
with occasional gusts of rain, and an ugly tempered east wind, which</p><p>
seemed to come right off the chill and melancholy sea, hardly mitigated</p><p>
by sweeping over the roofs, and amalgamating itself with the dusky</p><p>
element of city smoke.  All the effeminacy of past days had returned</p><p>
upon me at once.  Summer as it still was, I ordered a coal fire in the</p><p>
rusty grate, and was glad to find myself growing a little too warm with</p><p>
an artificial temperature.</p>
<p>
My sensations were those of a traveller, long sojourning in remote</p><p>
regions, and at length sitting down again amid customs once familiar.</p><p>
There was a newness and an oldness oddly combining themselves into one</p><p>
impression.  It made me acutely sensible how strange a piece of</p><p>
mosaic-work had lately been wrought into my life.  True, if you look at</p><p>
it in one way, it had been only a summer in the country.  But,</p><p>
considered in a profounder relation, it was part of another age, a</p><p>
different state of society, a segment of an existence peculiar in its</p><p>
aims and methods, a leaf of some mysterious volume interpolated into</p><p>
the current history which time was writing off.  At one moment, the</p><p>
very circumstances now surrounding me--my coal fire and the dingy room</p><p>
in the bustling hotel--appeared far off and intangible; the next</p><p>
instant Blithedale looked vague, as if it were at a distance both in</p><p>
time and space, and so shadowy that a question might be raised whether</p><p>
the whole affair had been anything more than the thoughts of a</p><p>
speculative man.  I had never before experienced a mood that so robbed</p><p>
the actual world of its solidity.  It nevertheless involved a charm, on</p><p>
which--a devoted epicure of my own emotions--I resolved to pause, and</p><p>
enjoy the moral sillabub until quite dissolved away.</p>
<p>
Whatever had been my taste for solitude and natural scenery, yet the</p><p>
thick, foggy, stifled element of cities, the entangled life of many men</p><p>
together, sordid as it was, and empty of the beautiful, took quite as</p><p>
strenuous a hold upon my mind.  I felt as if there could never be</p><p>
enough of it.  Each characteristic sound was too suggestive to be</p><p>
passed over unnoticed.  Beneath and around me, I heard the stir of the</p><p>
hotel; the loud voices of guests, landlord, or bar-keeper; steps</p><p>
echoing on the staircase; the ringing of a bell, announcing arrivals or</p><p>
departures; the porter lumbering past my door with baggage, which he</p><p>
thumped down upon the floors of neighboring chambers; the lighter feet</p><p>
of chambermaids scudding along the passages;--it is ridiculous to think</p><p>
what an interest they had for me! From the street came the tumult of</p><p>
the pavements, pervading the whole house with a continual uproar, so</p><p>
broad and deep that only an unaccustomed ear would dwell upon it.  A</p><p>
company of the city soldiery, with a full military band, marched in</p><p>
front of the hotel, invisible to me, but stirringly audible both by its</p><p>
foot-tramp and the clangor of its instruments.  Once or twice all the</p><p>
city bells jangled together, announcing a fire, which brought out the</p><p>
engine-men and their machines, like an army with its artillery rushing</p><p>
to battle. Hour by hour the clocks in many steeples responded one to</p><p>
another.</p>
<p>
In some public hall, not a great way off, there seemed to be an</p><p>
exhibition of a mechanical diorama; for three times during the day</p><p>
occurred a repetition of obstreperous music, winding up with the rattle</p><p>
of imitative cannon and musketry, and a huge final explosion. Then</p><p>
ensued the applause of the spectators, with clap of hands and thump of</p><p>
sticks, and the energetic pounding of their heels.  All this was just</p><p>
as valuable, in its way, as the sighing of the breeze among the</p><p>
birch-trees that overshadowed Eliot's pulpit.</p>
<p>
Yet I felt a hesitation about plunging into this muddy tide of human</p><p>
activity and pastime.  It suited me better, for the present, to linger</p><p>
on the brink, or hover in the air above it.  So I spent the first day,</p><p>
and the greater part of the second, in the laziest manner possible, in</p><p>
a rocking-chair, inhaling the fragrance of a series of cigars, with my</p><p>
legs and slippered feet horizontally disposed, and in my hand a novel</p><p>
purchased of a railroad bibliopolist.  The gradual waste of my cigar</p><p>
accomplished itself with an easy and gentle expenditure of breath.  My</p><p>
book was of the dullest, yet had a sort of sluggish flow, like that of</p><p>
a stream in which your boat is as often aground as afloat.  Had there</p><p>
been a more impetuous rush, a more absorbing passion of the narrative,</p><p>
I should the sooner have struggled out of its uneasy current, and have</p><p>
given myself up to the swell and subsidence of my thoughts.  But, as it</p><p>
was, the torpid life of the book served as an unobtrusive accompaniment</p><p>
to the life within me and about me.  At intervals, however, when its</p><p>
effect grew a little too soporific,--not for my patience, but for the</p><p>
possibility of keeping my eyes open, I bestirred myself, started from</p><p>
the rocking-chair, and looked out of the window.</p>
<p>
A gray sky; the weathercock of a steeple that rose beyond the opposite</p><p>
range of buildings, pointing from the eastward; a sprinkle of small,</p><p>
spiteful-looking raindrops on the window-pane.  In that ebb-tide of my</p><p>
energies, had I thought of venturing abroad, these tokens would have</p><p>
checked the abortive purpose.</p>
<p>
After several such visits to the window, I found myself getting pretty</p><p>
well acquainted with that little portion of the backside of the</p><p>
universe which it presented to my view.  Over against the hotel and its</p><p>
adjacent houses, at the distance of forty or fifty yards, was the rear</p><p>
of a range of buildings which appeared to be spacious, modern, and</p><p>
calculated for fashionable residences.  The interval between was</p><p>
apportioned into grass-plots, and here and there an apology for a</p><p>
garden, pertaining severally to these dwellings.  There were</p><p>
apple-trees, and pear and peach trees, too, the fruit on which looked</p><p>
singularly large, luxuriant, and abundant, as well it might, in a</p><p>
situation so warm and sheltered, and where the soil had doubtless been</p><p>
enriched to a more than natural fertility.  In two or three places</p><p>
grapevines clambered upon trellises, and bore clusters already purple,</p><p>
and promising the richness of Malta or Madeira in their ripened juice.</p><p>
The blighting winds of our rigid climate could not molest these trees</p><p>
and vines; the sunshine, though descending late into this area, and too</p><p>
early intercepted by the height of the surrounding houses, yet lay</p><p>
tropically there, even when less than temperate in every other region.</p><p>
Dreary as was the day, the scene was illuminated by not a few sparrows</p><p>
and other birds, which spread their wings, and flitted and fluttered,</p><p>
and alighted now here, now there, and busily scratched their food out</p><p>
of the wormy earth.  Most of these winged people seemed to have their</p><p>
domicile in a robust and healthy buttonwood-tree.  It aspired upward,</p><p>
high above the roofs of the houses, and spread a dense head of foliage</p><p>
half across the area.</p>
<p>
There was a cat--as there invariably is in such places--who evidently</p><p>
thought herself entitled to the privileges of forest life in this close</p><p>
heart of city conventionalisms.  I watched her creeping along the low,</p><p>
flat roofs of the offices, descending a flight of wooden steps, gliding</p><p>
among the grass, and besieging the buttonwood-tree, with murderous</p><p>
purpose against its feathered citizens.  But, after all, they were</p><p>
birds of city breeding, and doubtless knew how to guard themselves</p><p>
against the peculiar perils of their position.</p>
<p>
Bewitching to my fancy are all those nooks and crannies where Nature,</p><p>
like a stray partridge, hides her head among the long-established</p><p>
haunts of men!  It is likewise to be remarked, as a general rule, that</p><p>
there is far more of the picturesque, more truth to native and</p><p>
characteristic tendencies, and vastly greater suggestiveness in the</p><p>
back view of a residence, whether in town or country, than in its</p><p>
front.  The latter is always artificial; it is meant for the world's</p><p>
eye, and is therefore a veil and a concealment.  Realities keep in the</p><p>
rear, and put forward an advance guard of show and humbug.  The</p><p>
posterior aspect of any old farmhouse, behind which a railroad has</p><p>
unexpectedly been opened, is so different from that looking upon the</p><p>
immemorial highway, that the spectator gets new ideas of rural life and</p><p>
individuality in the puff or two of steam-breath which shoots him past</p><p>
the premises.  In a city, the distinction between what is offered to</p><p>
the public and what is kept for the family is certainly not less</p><p>
striking.</p>
<p>
But, to return to my window at the back of the hotel.  Together with a</p><p>
due contemplation of the fruit-trees, the grapevines, the</p><p>
buttonwood-tree, the cat, the birds, and many other particulars, I</p><p>
failed not to study the row of fashionable dwellings to which all these</p><p>
appertained.  Here, it must be confessed, there was a general sameness.</p><p>
From the upper story to the first floor, they were so much alike, that</p><p>
I could only conceive of the inhabitants as cut out on one identical</p><p>
pattern, like little wooden toy-people of German manufacture.  One</p><p>
long, united roof, with its thousands of slates glittering in the rain,</p><p>
extended over the whole.  After the distinctness of separate characters</p><p>
to which I had recently been accustomed, it perplexed and annoyed me</p><p>
not to be able to resolve this combination of human interests into</p><p>
well-defined elements.  It seemed hardly worth while for more than one</p><p>
of those families to be in existence, since they all had the same</p><p>
glimpse of the sky, all looked into the same area, all received just</p><p>
their equal share of sunshine through the front windows, and all</p><p>
listened to precisely the same noises of the street on which they</p><p>
boarded.  Men are so much alike in their nature, that they grow</p><p>
intolerable unless varied by their circumstances.</p>
<p>
Just about this time a waiter entered my room.  The truth was, I had</p><p>
rung the bell and ordered a sherry-cobbler.</p>
<p>
"Can you tell me," I inquired, "what families reside in any of those</p><p>
houses opposite?"</p>
<p>
"The one right opposite is a rather stylish boarding-house," said the</p><p>
waiter.  "Two of the gentlemen boarders keep horses at the stable of</p><p>
our establishment.  They do things in very good style, sir, the people</p><p>
that live there."</p>
<p>
I might have found out nearly as much for myself, on examining the</p><p>
house a little more closely, in one of the upper chambers I saw a young</p><p>
man in a dressing-gown, standing before the glass and brushing his hair</p><p>
for a quarter of an hour together.  He then spent an equal space of</p><p>
time in the elaborate arrangement of his cravat, and finally made his</p><p>
appearance in a dress-coat, which I suspected to be newly come from the</p><p>
tailor's, and now first put on for a dinner-party.  At a window of the</p><p>
next story below, two children, prettily dressed, were looking out.  By</p><p>
and by a middle-aged gentleman came softly behind them, kissed the</p><p>
little girl, and playfully pulled the little boy's ear.  It was a papa,</p><p>
no doubt, just come in from his counting-room or office; and anon</p><p>
appeared mamma, stealing as softly behind papa as he had stolen behind</p><p>
the children, and laying her hand on his shoulder to surprise him.</p><p>
Then followed a kiss between papa and mamma; but a noiseless one, for</p><p>
the children did not turn their heads.</p>
<p>
"I bless God for these good folks!" thought I to myself.  "I have not</p><p>
seen a prettier bit of nature, in all my summer in the country, than</p><p>
they have shown me here, in a rather stylish boarding-house.  I will</p><p>
pay them a little more attention by and by."</p>
<p>
On the first floor, an iron balustrade ran along in front of the tall</p><p>
and spacious windows, evidently belonging to a back drawing-room; and</p><p>
far into the interior, through the arch of the sliding-doors, I could</p><p>
discern a gleam from the windows of the front apartment.  There were no</p><p>
signs of present occupancy in this suite of rooms; the curtains being</p><p>
enveloped in a protective covering, which allowed but a small portion</p><p>
of their crimson material to be seen.  But two housemaids were</p><p>
industriously at work; so that there was good prospect that the</p><p>
boarding-house might not long suffer from the absence of its most</p><p>
expensive and profitable guests.  Meanwhile, until they should appear,</p><p>
I cast my eyes downward to the lower regions.  There, in the dusk that</p><p>
so early settles into such places, I saw the red glow of the kitchen</p><p>
range.  The hot cook, or one of her subordinates, with a ladle in her</p><p>
hand, came to draw a cool breath at the back door.  As soon as she</p><p>
disappeared, an Irish man-servant, in a white jacket, crept slyly</p><p>
forth, and threw away the fragments of a china dish, which,</p><p>
unquestionably, he had just broken.  Soon afterwards, a lady, showily</p><p>
dressed, with a curling front of what must have been false hair, and</p><p>
reddish-brown, I suppose, in hue,--though my remoteness allowed me only</p><p>
to guess at such particulars,--this respectable mistress of the</p><p>
boarding-house made a momentary transit across the kitchen window, and</p><p>
appeared no more.  It was her final, comprehensive glance, in order to</p><p>
make sure that soup, fish, and flesh were in a proper state of</p><p>
readiness, before the serving up of dinner.</p>
<p>
There was nothing else worth noticing about the house, unless it be</p><p>
that on the peak of one of the dormer windows which opened out of the</p><p>
roof sat a dove, looking very dreary and forlorn; insomuch that I</p><p>
wondered why she chose to sit there, in the chilly rain, while her</p><p>
kindred were doubtless nestling in a warm and comfortable dove-cote.</p><p>
All at once this dove spread her wings, and, launching herself in the</p><p>
air, came flying so straight across the intervening space, that I fully</p><p>
expected her to alight directly on my window-sill.  In the latter part</p><p>
of her course, however, she swerved aside, flew upward, and vanished,</p><p>
as did, likewise, the slight, fantastic pathos with which I had</p><p>
invested her.</p>
<p>
XVIII. THE BOARDING-HOUSE</p>
<p>
The next day, as soon as I thought of looking again towards the</p><p>
opposite house, there sat the dove again, on the peak of the same</p><p>
dormer window!  It was by no means an early hour, for the preceding</p><p>
evening I had ultimately mustered enterprise enough to visit the</p><p>
theatre, had gone late to bed, and slept beyond all limit, in my</p><p>
remoteness from Silas Foster's awakening horn.  Dreams had tormented me</p><p>
throughout the night.  The train of thoughts which, for months past,</p><p>
had worn a track through my mind, and to escape which was one of my</p><p>
chief objects in leaving Blithedale, kept treading remorselessly to and</p><p>
fro in their old footsteps, while slumber left me impotent to regulate</p><p>
them.  It was not till I had quitted my three friends that they first</p><p>
began to encroach upon my dreams.  In those of the last night,</p><p>
Hollingsworth and Zenobia, standing on either side of my bed, had bent</p><p>
across it to exchange a kiss of passion. Priscilla, beholding</p><p>
this,--for she seemed to be peeping in at the chamber window,--had</p><p>
melted gradually away, and left only the sadness of her expression in</p><p>
my heart.  There it still lingered, after I awoke; one of those</p><p>
unreasonable sadnesses that you know not how to deal with, because it</p><p>
involves nothing for common-sense to clutch.</p>
<p>
It was a gray and dripping forenoon; gloomy enough in town, and still</p><p>
gloomier in the haunts to which my recollections persisted in</p><p>
transporting me.  For, in spite of my efforts to think of something</p><p>
else, I thought how the gusty rain was drifting over the slopes and</p><p>
valleys of our farm; how wet must be the foliage that overshadowed the</p><p>
pulpit rock; how cheerless, in such a day, my hermitage--the</p><p>
tree-solitude of my owl-like humors--in the vine-encircled heart of the</p><p>
tall pine!  It was a phase of homesickness.  I had wrenched myself too</p><p>
suddenly out of an accustomed sphere.  There was no choice, now, but to</p><p>
bear the pang of whatever heartstrings were snapt asunder, and that</p><p>
illusive torment (like the ache of a limb long ago cut off) by which a</p><p>
past mode of life prolongs itself into the succeeding one.  I was full</p><p>
of idle and shapeless regrets.  The thought impressed itself upon me</p><p>
that I had left duties unperformed. With the power, perhaps, to act in</p><p>
the place of destiny and avert misfortune from my friends, I had</p><p>
resigned them to their fate.  That cold tendency, between instinct and</p><p>
intellect, which made me pry with a speculative interest into people's</p><p>
passions and impulses, appeared to have gone far towards unhumanizing</p><p>
my heart.</p>
<p>
But a man cannot always decide for himself whether his own heart is</p><p>
cold or warm.  It now impresses me that, if I erred at all in regard to</p><p>
Hollingsworth, Zenobia, and Priscilla, it was through too much</p><p>
sympathy, rather than too little.</p>
<p>
To escape the irksomeness of these meditations, I resumed my post at</p><p>
the window.  At first sight, there was nothing new to be noticed. The</p><p>
general aspect of affairs was the same as yesterday, except that the</p><p>
more decided inclemency of to-day had driven the sparrows to shelter,</p><p>
and kept the cat within doors; whence, however, she soon emerged,</p><p>
pursued by the cook, and with what looked like the better half of a</p><p>
roast chicken in her mouth.  The young man in the dress-coat was</p><p>
invisible; the two children, in the story below, seemed to be romping</p><p>
about the room, under the superintendence of a nursery-maid.  The</p><p>
damask curtains of the drawing-room, on the first floor, were now fully</p><p>
displayed, festooned gracefully from top to bottom of the windows,</p><p>
which extended from the ceiling to the carpet. A narrower window, at</p><p>
the left of the drawing-room, gave light to what was probably a small</p><p>
boudoir, within which I caught the faintest imaginable glimpse of a</p><p>
girl's figure, in airy drapery.  Her arm was in regular movement, as if</p><p>
she were busy with her German worsted, or some other such pretty and</p><p>
unprofitable handiwork.</p>
<p>
While intent upon making out this girlish shape, I became sensible that</p><p>
a figure had appeared at one of the windows of the drawing-room. There</p><p>
was a presentiment in my mind; or perhaps my first glance, imperfect</p><p>
and sidelong as it was, had sufficed to convey subtile information of</p><p>
the truth.  At any rate, it was with no positive surprise, but as if I</p><p>
had all along expected the incident, that, directing my eyes</p><p>
thitherward, I beheld--like a full-length picture, in the space between</p><p>
the heavy festoons of the window curtains--no other than Zenobia!  At</p><p>
the same instant, my thoughts made sure of the identity of the figure</p><p>
in the boudoir.  It could only be Priscilla.</p>
<p>
Zenobia was attired, not in the almost rustic costume which she had</p><p>
heretofore worn, but in a fashionable morning-dress.  There was,</p><p>
nevertheless, one familiar point.  She had, as usual, a flower in her</p><p>
hair, brilliant and of a rare variety, else it had not been Zenobia.</p><p>
After a brief pause at the window, she turned away, exemplifying, in</p><p>
the few steps that removed her out of sight, that noble and beautiful</p><p>
motion which characterized her as much as any other personal charm. Not</p><p>
one woman in a thousand could move so admirably as Zenobia.  Many women</p><p>
can sit gracefully; some can stand gracefully; and a few, perhaps, can</p><p>
assume a series of graceful positions.  But natural movement is the</p><p>
result and expression of the whole being, and cannot be well and nobly</p><p>
performed unless responsive to something in the character.  I often</p><p>
used to think that music--light and airy, wild and passionate, or the</p><p>
full harmony of stately marches, in accordance with her varying</p><p>
mood--should have attended Zenobia's footsteps.</p>
<p>
I waited for her reappearance.  It was one peculiarity, distinguishing</p><p>
Zenobia from most of her sex, that she needed for her moral well-being,</p><p>
and never would forego, a large amount of physical exercise.  At</p><p>
Blithedale, no inclemency of sky or muddiness of earth had ever impeded</p><p>
her daily walks.  Here in town, she probably preferred to tread the</p><p>
extent of the two drawing-rooms, and measure out the miles by spaces of</p><p>
forty feet, rather than bedraggle her skirts over the sloppy pavements.</p><p>
Accordingly, in about the time requisite to pass through the arch of</p><p>
the sliding-doors to the front window, and to return upon her steps,</p><p>
there she stood again, between the festoons of the crimson curtains.</p><p>
But another personage was now added to the scene.  Behind Zenobia</p><p>
appeared that face which I had first encountered in the wood-path; the</p><p>
man who had passed, side by side with her, in such mysterious</p><p>
familiarity and estrangement, beneath my vine curtained hermitage in</p><p>
the tall pine-tree.  It was Westervelt.  And though he was looking</p><p>
closely over her shoulder, it still seemed to me, as on the former</p><p>
occasion, that Zenobia repelled him,--that, perchance, they mutually</p><p>
repelled each other, by some incompatibility of their spheres.</p>
<p>
This impression, however, might have been altogether the result of</p><p>
fancy and prejudice in me.  The distance was so great as to obliterate</p><p>
any play of feature by which I might otherwise have been made a</p><p>
partaker of their counsels.</p>
<p>
There now needed only Hollingsworth and old Moodie to complete the knot</p><p>
of characters, whom a real intricacy of events, greatly assisted by my</p><p>
method of insulating them from other relations, had kept so long upon</p><p>
my mental stage, as actors in a drama.  In itself, perhaps, it was no</p><p>
very remarkable event that they should thus come across me, at the</p><p>
moment when I imagined myself free.  Zenobia, as I well knew, had</p><p>
retained an establishment in town, and had not unfrequently withdrawn</p><p>
herself from Blithedale during brief intervals, on one of which</p><p>
occasions she had taken Priscilla along with her.  Nevertheless, there</p><p>
seemed something fatal in the coincidence that had borne me to this one</p><p>
spot, of all others in a great city, and transfixed me there, and</p><p>
compelled me again to waste my already wearied sympathies on affairs</p><p>
which were none of mine, and persons who cared little for me.  It</p><p>
irritated my nerves; it affected me with a kind of heart-sickness.</p><p>
After the effort which it cost me to fling them off,--after</p><p>
consummating my escape, as I thought, from these goblins of flesh and</p><p>
blood, and pausing to revive myself with a breath or two of an</p><p>
atmosphere in which they should have no share,--it was a positive</p><p>
despair to find the same figures arraying themselves before me, and</p><p>
presenting their old problem in a shape that made it more insoluble</p><p>
than ever.</p>
<p>
I began to long for a catastrophe.  If the noble temper of</p><p>
Hollingsworth's soul were doomed to be utterly corrupted by the too</p><p>
powerful purpose which had grown out of what was noblest in him; if the</p><p>
rich and generous qualities of Zenobia's womanhood might not save her;</p><p>
if Priscilla must perish by her tenderness and faith, so simple and so</p><p>
devout, then be it so!  Let it all come!  As for me, I would look on,</p><p>
as it seemed my part to do, understandingly, if my intellect could</p><p>
fathom the meaning and the moral, and, at all events, reverently and</p><p>
sadly.  The curtain fallen, I would pass onward with my poor individual</p><p>
life, which was now attenuated of much of its proper substance, and</p><p>
diffused among many alien interests.</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, Zenobia and her companion had retreated from the window.</p><p>
Then followed an interval, during which I directed my eves towards the</p><p>
figure in the boudoir.  Most certainly it was Priscilla, although</p><p>
dressed with a novel and fanciful elegance.  The vague perception of</p><p>
it, as viewed so far off, impressed me as if she had suddenly passed</p><p>
out of a chrysalis state and put forth wings.  Her hands were not now</p><p>
in motion.  She had dropt her work, and sat with her head thrown back,</p><p>
in the same attitude that I had seen several times before, when she</p><p>
seemed to be listening to an imperfectly distinguished sound.</p>
<p>
Again the two figures in the drawing-room became visible.  They were</p><p>
now a little withdrawn from the window, face to face, and, as I could</p><p>
see by Zenobia's emphatic gestures, were discussing some subject in</p><p>
which she, at least, felt a passionate concern.  By and by she broke</p><p>
away, and vanished beyond my ken.  Westervelt approached the window,</p><p>
and leaned his forehead against a pane of glass, displaying the sort of</p><p>
smile on his handsome features which, when I before met him, had let me</p><p>
into the secret of his gold-bordered teeth.  Every human being, when</p><p>
given over to the Devil, is sure to have the wizard mark upon him, in</p><p>
one form or another.  I fancied that this smile, with its peculiar</p><p>
revelation, was the Devil's signet on the Professor.</p>
<p>
This man, as I had soon reason to know, was endowed with a cat-like</p><p>
circumspection; and though precisely the most unspiritual quality in</p><p>
the world, it was almost as effective as spiritual insight in making</p><p>
him acquainted with whatever it suited him to discover.  He now proved</p><p>
it, considerably to my discomfiture, by detecting and recognizing me,</p><p>
at my post of observation.  Perhaps I ought to have blushed at being</p><p>
caught in such an evident scrutiny of Professor Westervelt and his</p><p>
affairs.  Perhaps I did blush.  Be that as it might, I retained</p><p>
presence of mind enough not to make my position yet more irksome by the</p><p>
poltroonery of drawing back.</p>
<p>
Westervelt looked into the depths of the drawing-room, and beckoned.</p><p>
Immediately afterwards Zenobia appeared at the window, with color much</p><p>
heightened, and eyes which, as my conscience whispered me, were</p><p>
shooting bright arrows, barbed with scorn, across the intervening</p><p>
space, directed full at my sensibilities as a gentleman.  If the truth</p><p>
must be told, far as her flight-shot was, those arrows hit the mark.</p><p>
She signified her recognition of me by a gesture with her head and</p><p>
hand, comprising at once a salutation and dismissal.  The next moment</p><p>
she administered one of those pitiless rebukes which a woman always has</p><p>
at hand, ready for any offence (and which she so seldom spares on due</p><p>
occasion), by letting down a white linen curtain between the festoons</p><p>
of the damask ones.  It fell like the drop-curtain of a theatre, in the</p><p>
interval between the acts.</p>
<p>
Priscilla had disappeared from the boudoir.  But the dove still kept</p><p>
her desolate perch on the peak of the attic window.</p>
<p>
XIX. ZENOBIA'S DRAWING-ROOM</p>
<p>
The remainder of the day, so far as I was concerned, was spent in</p><p>
meditating on these recent incidents.  I contrived, and alternately</p><p>
rejected, innumerable methods of accounting for the presence of Zenobia</p><p>
and Priscilla, and the connection of Westervelt with both. It must be</p><p>
owned, too, that I had a keen, revengeful sense of the insult inflicted</p><p>
by Zenobia's scornful recognition, and more particularly by her letting</p><p>
down the curtain; as if such were the proper barrier to be interposed</p><p>
between a character like hers and a perceptive faculty like mine.  For,</p><p>
was mine a mere vulgar curiosity? Zenobia should have known me better</p><p>
than to suppose it.  She should have been able to appreciate that</p><p>
quality of the intellect and the heart which impelled me (often against</p><p>
my own will, and to the detriment of my own comfort) to live in other</p><p>
lives, and to endeavor--by generous sympathies, by delicate intuitions,</p><p>
by taking note of things too slight for record, and by bringing my</p><p>
human spirit into manifold accordance with the companions whom God</p><p>
assigned me--to learn the secret which was hidden even from themselves.</p>
<p>
Of all possible observers, methought a woman like Zenobia and a man</p><p>
like Hollingsworth should have selected me.  And now when the event has</p><p>
long been past, I retain the same opinion of my fitness for the office.</p><p>
True, I might have condemned them.  Had I been judge as well as</p><p>
witness, my sentence might have been stern as that of destiny itself.</p><p>
But, still, no trait of original nobility of character, no struggle</p><p>
against temptation,--no iron necessity of will, on the one hand, nor</p><p>
extenuating circumstance to be derived from passion and despair, on the</p><p>
other,--no remorse that might coexist with error, even if powerless to</p><p>
prevent it,--no proud repentance that should claim retribution as a</p><p>
meed,--would go unappreciated.  True, again, I might give my full</p><p>
assent to the punishment which was sure to follow. But it would be</p><p>
given mournfully, and with undiminished love.  And, after all was</p><p>
finished, I would come as if to gather up the white ashes of those who</p><p>
had perished at the stake, and to tell the world--the wrong being now</p><p>
atoned for--how much had perished there which it had never yet known</p><p>
how to praise.</p>
<p>
I sat in my rocking-chair, too far withdrawn from the window to expose</p><p>
myself to another rebuke like that already inflicted.  My eyes still</p><p>
wandered towards the opposite house, but without effecting any new</p><p>
discoveries.  Late in the afternoon, the weathercock on the church</p><p>
spire indicated a change of wind; the sun shone dimly out, as if the</p><p>
golden wine of its beams were mingled half-and-half with water.</p><p>
Nevertheless, they kindled up the whole range of edifices, threw a glow</p><p>
over the windows, glistened on the wet roofs, and, slowly withdrawing</p><p>
upward, perched upon the chimney-tops; thence they took a higher</p><p>
flight, and lingered an instant on the tip of the spire, making it the</p><p>
final point of more cheerful light in the whole sombre scene.  The next</p><p>
moment, it was all gone.  The twilight fell into the area like a shower</p><p>
of dusky snow, and before it was quite dark, the gong of the hotel</p><p>
summoned me to tea.</p>
<p>
When I returned to my chamber, the glow of an astral lamp was</p><p>
penetrating mistily through the white curtain of Zenobia's</p><p>
drawing-room.  The shadow of a passing figure was now and then cast</p><p>
upon this medium, but with too vague an outline for even my adventurous</p><p>
conjectures to read the hieroglyphic that it presented.</p>
<p>
All at once, it occurred to me how very absurd was my behavior in thus</p><p>
tormenting myself with crazy hypotheses as to what was going on within</p><p>
that drawing-room, when it was at my option to be personally present</p><p>
there, My relations with Zenobia, as yet unchanged,--as a familiar</p><p>
friend, and associated in the same life-long enterprise,--gave me the</p><p>
right, and made it no more than kindly courtesy demanded, to call on</p><p>
her.  Nothing, except our habitual independence of conventional rules</p><p>
at Blithedale, could have kept me from sooner recognizing this duty.</p><p>
At all events, it should now be performed.</p>
<p>
In compliance with this sudden impulse, I soon found myself actually</p><p>
within the house, the rear of which, for two days past, I had been so</p><p>
sedulously watching.  A servant took my card, and, immediately</p><p>
returning, ushered me upstairs.  On the way, I heard a rich, and, as it</p><p>
were, triumphant burst of music from a piano, in which I felt Zenobia's</p><p>
character, although heretofore I had known nothing of her skill upon</p><p>
the instrument.  Two or three canary-birds, excited by this gush of</p><p>
sound, sang piercingly, and did their utmost to produce a kindred</p><p>
melody.  A bright illumination streamed through, the door of the front</p><p>
drawing-room; and I had barely stept across the threshold before</p><p>
Zenobia came forward to meet me, laughing, and with an extended hand.</p>
<p>
"Ah, Mr. Coverdale," said she, still smiling, but, as I thought, with a</p><p>
good deal of scornful anger underneath, "it has gratified me to see the</p><p>
interest which you continue to take in my affairs!  I have long</p><p>
recognized you as a sort of transcendental Yankee, with all the native</p><p>
propensity of your countrymen to investigate matters that come within</p><p>
their range, but rendered almost poetical, in your case, by the refined</p><p>
methods which you adopt for its gratification.  After all, it was an</p><p>
unjustifiable stroke, on my part,--was it not?--to let down the window</p><p>
curtain!"</p>
<p>
"I cannot call it a very wise one," returned I, with a secret</p><p>
bitterness, which, no doubt, Zenobia appreciated.  "It is really</p><p>
impossible to hide anything in this world, to say nothing of the next.</p><p>
All that we ought to ask, therefore, is, that the witnesses of our</p><p>
conduct, and the speculators on our motives, should be capable of</p><p>
taking the highest view which the circumstances of the case may admit.</p><p>
So much being secured, I, for one, would be most happy in feeling</p><p>
myself followed everywhere by an indefatigable human sympathy."</p>
<p>
"We must trust for intelligent sympathy to our guardian angels, if any</p><p>
there be," said Zenobia.  "As long as the only spectator of my poor</p><p>
tragedy is a young man at the window of his hotel, I must still claim</p><p>
the liberty to drop the curtain."</p>
<p>
While this passed, as Zenobia's hand was extended, I had applied the</p><p>
very slightest touch of my fingers to her own.  In spite of an external</p><p>
freedom, her manner made me sensible that we stood upon no real terms</p><p>
of confidence.  The thought came sadly across me, how great was the</p><p>
contrast betwixt this interview and our first meeting. Then, in the</p><p>
warm light of the country fireside, Zenobia had greeted me cheerily and</p><p>
hopefully, with a full sisterly grasp of the hand, conveying as much</p><p>
kindness in it as other women could have evinced by the pressure of</p><p>
both arms around my neck, or by yielding a cheek to the brotherly</p><p>
salute.  The difference was as complete as between her appearance at</p><p>
that time--so simply attired, and with only the one superb flower in</p><p>
her hair--and now, when her beauty was set off by all that dress and</p><p>
ornament could do for it.  And they did much.  Not, indeed, that they</p><p>
created or added anything to what Nature had lavishly done for Zenobia.</p><p>
But, those costly robes which she had on, those flaming jewels on her</p><p>
neck, served as lamps to display the personal advantages which required</p><p>
nothing less than such an illumination to be fully seen.  Even her</p><p>
characteristic flower, though it seemed to be still there, had</p><p>
undergone a cold and bright transfiguration; it was a flower</p><p>
exquisitely imitated in jeweller's work, and imparting the last touch</p><p>
that transformed Zenobia into a work of art.</p>
<p>
"I scarcely feel," I could not forbear saying, "as if we had ever met</p><p>
before.  How many years ago it seems since we last sat beneath Eliot's</p><p>
pulpit, with Hollingsworth extended on the fallen leaves, and Priscilla</p><p>
at his feet!  Can it be, Zenobia, that you ever really numbered</p><p>
yourself with our little band of earnest, thoughtful, philanthropic</p><p>
laborers?"</p>
<p>
"Those ideas have their time and place," she answered coldly.  "But I</p><p>
fancy it must be a very circumscribed mind that can find room for no</p><p>
other."</p>
<p>
Her manner bewildered me.  Literally, moreover, I was dazzled by the</p><p>
brilliancy of the room.  A chandelier hung down in the centre, glowing</p><p>
with I know not how many lights; there were separate lamps, also, on</p><p>
two or three tables, and on marble brackets, adding their white</p><p>
radiance to that of the chandelier.  The furniture was exceedingly</p><p>
rich.  Fresh from our old farmhouse, with its homely board and benches</p><p>
in the dining-room, and a few wicker chairs in the best parlor, it</p><p>
struck me that here was the fulfilment of every fantasy of an</p><p>
imagination revelling in various methods of costly self-indulgence and</p><p>
splendid ease.  Pictures, marbles, vases,--in brief, more shapes of</p><p>
luxury than there could be any object in enumerating, except for an</p><p>
auctioneer's advertisement,--and the whole repeated and doubled by the</p><p>
reflection of a great mirror, which showed me Zenobia's proud figure,</p><p>
likewise, and my own.  It cost me, I acknowledge, a bitter sense of</p><p>
shame, to perceive in myself a positive effort to bear up against the</p><p>
effect which Zenobia sought to impose on me.  I reasoned against her,</p><p>
in my secret mind, and strove so to keep my footing.  In the</p><p>
gorgeousness with which she had surrounded herself,--in the redundance</p><p>
of personal ornament, which the largeness of her physical nature and</p><p>
the rich type of her beauty caused to seem so suitable,--I malevolently</p><p>
beheld the true character of the woman, passionate, luxurious, lacking</p><p>
simplicity, not deeply refined, incapable of pure and perfect taste.</p><p>
But, the next instant, she was too powerful for all my opposing</p><p>
struggles.  I saw how fit it was that she should make herself as</p><p>
gorgeous as she pleased, and should do a thousand things that would</p><p>
have been ridiculous in the poor, thin, weakly characters of other</p><p>
women.  To this day, however, I hardly know whether I then beheld</p><p>
Zenobia in her truest attitude, or whether that were the truer one in</p><p>
which she had presented herself at Blithedale.  In both, there was</p><p>
something like the illusion which a great actress flings around her.</p>
<p>
"Have you given up Blithedale forever?"  I inquired.</p>
<p>
"Why should you think so?" asked she.</p>
<p>
"I cannot tell," answered I; "except that it appears all like a dream</p><p>
that we were ever there together."</p>
<p>
"It is not so to me," said Zenobia.  "I should think it a poor and</p><p>
meagre nature that is capable of but one set of forms, and must convert</p><p>
all the past into a dream merely because the present happens to be</p><p>
unlike it.  Why should we be content with our homely life of a few</p><p>
months past, to the exclusion of all other modes?  It was good; but</p><p>
there are other lives as good, or better.  Not, you will understand,</p><p>
that I condemn those who give themselves up to it more entirely than I,</p><p>
for myself, should deem it wise to do."</p>
<p>
It irritated me, this self-complacent, condescending, qualified</p><p>
approval and criticism of a system to which many individuals--perhaps</p><p>
as highly endowed as our gorgeous Zenobia--had contributed their all of</p><p>
earthly endeavor, and their loftiest aspirations.  I determined to make</p><p>
proof if there were any spell that would exorcise her out of the part</p><p>
which she seemed to be acting.  She should be compelled to give me a</p><p>
glimpse of something true; some nature, some passion, no matter whether</p><p>
right or wrong, provided it were real.</p>
<p>
"Your allusion to that class of circumscribed characters who can live</p><p>
only in one mode of life," remarked I coolly, "reminds me of our poor</p><p>
friend Hollingsworth.  Possibly he was in your thoughts when you spoke</p><p>
thus.  Poor fellow!  It is a pity that, by the fault of a narrow</p><p>
education, he should have so completely immolated himself to that one</p><p>
idea of his, especially as the slightest modicum of common-sense would</p><p>
teach him its utter impracticability.  Now that I have returned into</p><p>
the world, and can look at his project from a distance, it requires</p><p>
quite all my real regard for this respectable and well-intentioned man</p><p>
to prevent me laughing at him,--as I find society at large does."</p>
<p>
Zenobia's eyes darted lightning, her cheeks flushed, the vividness of</p><p>
her expression was like the effect of a powerful light flaming up</p><p>
suddenly within her.  My experiment had fully succeeded.  She had shown</p><p>
me the true flesh and blood of her heart, by thus involuntarily</p><p>
resenting my slight, pitying, half-kind, half-scornful mention of the</p><p>
man who was all in all with her.  She herself probably felt this; for</p><p>
it was hardly a moment before she tranquillized her uneven breath, and</p><p>
seemed as proud and self-possessed as ever.</p>
<p>
"I rather imagine," said she quietly, "that your appreciation falls</p><p>
short of Mr. Hollingsworth's just claims.  Blind enthusiasm, absorption</p><p>
in one idea, I grant, is generally ridiculous, and must be fatal to the</p><p>
respectability of an ordinary man; it requires a very high and powerful</p><p>
character to make it otherwise.  But a great man--as, perhaps, you do</p><p>
not know--attains his normal condition only through the inspiration of</p><p>
one great idea.  As a friend of Mr. Hollingsworth, and, at the same</p><p>
time, a calm observer, I must tell you that he seems to me such a man.</p><p>
But you are very pardonable for fancying him ridiculous.  Doubtless, he</p><p>
is so--to you!  There can be no truer test of the noble and heroic, in</p><p>
any individual, than the degree in which he possesses the faculty of</p><p>
distinguishing heroism from absurdity."</p>
<p>
I dared make no retort to Zenobia's concluding apothegm.  In truth, I</p><p>
admired her fidelity.  It gave me a new sense of Hollingsworth's native</p><p>
power, to discover that his influence was no less potent with this</p><p>
beautiful woman here, in the midst of artificial life, than it had been</p><p>
at the foot of the gray rock, and among the wild birch-trees of the</p><p>
wood-path, when she so passionately pressed his hand against her heart.</p><p>
The great, rude, shaggy, swarthy man!  And Zenobia loved him!</p>
<p>
"Did you bring Priscilla with you?"  I resumed.  "Do you know I have</p><p>
sometimes fancied it not quite safe, considering the susceptibility of</p><p>
her temperament, that she should be so constantly within the sphere of</p><p>
a man like Hollingsworth.  Such tender and delicate natures, among your</p><p>
sex, have often, I believe, a very adequate appreciation of the heroic</p><p>
element in men.  But then, again, I should suppose them as likely as</p><p>
any other women to make a reciprocal impression. Hollingsworth could</p><p>
hardly give his affections to a person capable of taking an independent</p><p>
stand, but only to one whom he might absorb into himself.  He has</p><p>
certainly shown great tenderness for Priscilla."</p>
<p>
Zenobia had turned aside.  But I caught the reflection of her face in</p><p>
the mirror, and saw that it was very pale,--as pale, in her rich</p><p>
attire, as if a shroud were round her.</p>
<p>
"Priscilla is here," said she, her voice a little lower than usual.</p><p>
"Have not you learnt as much from your chamber window?  Would you like</p><p>
to see her?"</p>
<p>
She made a step or two into the back drawing-room, and</p><p>
called,--"Priscilla!  Dear Priscilla!"</p>
<p>
XX. THEY VANISH</p>
<p>
Priscilla immediately answered the summons, and made her appearance</p><p>
through the door of the boudoir.  I had conceived the idea, which I now</p><p>
recognized as a very foolish one, that Zenobia would have taken</p><p>
measures to debar me from an interview with this girl, between whom and</p><p>
herself there was so utter an opposition of their dearest interests,</p><p>
that, on one part or the other, a great grief, if not likewise a great</p><p>
wrong, seemed a matter of necessity.  But, as Priscilla was only a leaf</p><p>
floating on the dark current of events, without influencing them by her</p><p>
own choice or plan, as she probably guessed not whither the stream was</p><p>
bearing her, nor perhaps even felt its inevitable movement,--there</p><p>
could be no peril of her communicating to me any intelligence with</p><p>
regard to Zenobia's purposes.</p>
<p>
On perceiving me, she came forward with great quietude of manner; and</p><p>
when I held out my hand, her own moved slightly towards it, as if</p><p>
attracted by a feeble degree of magnetism.</p>
<p>
"I am glad to see you, my dear Priscilla," said I, still holding her</p><p>
hand; "but everything that I meet with nowadays makes me wonder whether</p><p>
I am awake.  You, especially, have always seemed like a figure in a</p><p>
dream, and now more than ever."</p>
<p>
"Oh, there is substance in these fingers of mine," she answered, giving</p><p>
my hand the faintest possible pressure, and then taking away her own.</p><p>
"Why do you call me a dream?  Zenobia is much more like one than I; she</p><p>
is so very, very beautiful!  And, I suppose," added Priscilla, as if</p><p>
thinking aloud, "everybody sees it, as I do."</p>
<p>
But, for my part, it was Priscilla's beauty, not Zenobia's, of which I</p><p>
was thinking at that moment.  She was a person who could be quite</p><p>
obliterated, so far as beauty went, by anything unsuitable in her</p><p>
attire; her charm was not positive and material enough to bear up</p><p>
against a mistaken choice of color, for instance, or fashion.  It was</p><p>
safest, in her case, to attempt no art of dress; for it demanded the</p><p>
most perfect taste, or else the happiest accident in the world, to give</p><p>
her precisely the adornment which she needed.  She was now dressed in</p><p>
pure white, set off with some kind of a gauzy fabric, which--as I bring</p><p>
up her figure in my memory, with a faint gleam on her shadowy hair, and</p><p>
her dark eyes bent shyly on mine, through all the vanished years--seems</p><p>
to be floating about her like a mist.  I wondered what Zenobia meant by</p><p>
evolving so much loveliness out of this poor girl.  It was what few</p><p>
women could afford to do; for, as I looked from one to the other, the</p><p>
sheen and splendor of Zenobia's presence took nothing from Priscilla's</p><p>
softer spell, if it might not rather be thought to add to it.</p>
<p>
"What do you think of her?" asked Zenobia.</p>
<p>
I could not understand the look of melancholy kindness with which</p><p>
Zenobia regarded her.  She advanced a step, and beckoning Priscilla</p><p>
near her, kissed her cheek; then, with a slight gesture of repulse, she</p><p>
moved to the other side of the room.  I followed.</p>
<p>
"She is a wonderful creature," I said.  "Ever since she came among us,</p><p>
I have been dimly sensible of just this charm which you have brought</p><p>
out.  But it was never absolutely visible till now.  She is as lovely</p><p>
as a flower!"</p>
<p>
"Well, say so if you like," answered Zenobia.  "You are a poet,--at</p><p>
least, as poets go nowadays,--and must be allowed to make an</p><p>
opera-glass of your imagination, when you look at women.  I wonder, in</p><p>
such Arcadian freedom of falling in love as we have lately enjoyed, it</p><p>
never occurred to you to fall in love with Priscilla.  In society,</p><p>
indeed, a genuine American never dreams of stepping across the</p><p>
inappreciable air-line which separates one class from another.  But</p><p>
what was rank to the colonists of Blithedale?"</p>
<p>
"There were other reasons," I replied, "why I should have demonstrated</p><p>
myself an ass, had I fallen in love with Priscilla.  By the bye, has</p><p>
Hollingsworth ever seen her in this dress?"</p>
<p>
"Why do you bring up his name at every turn?" asked Zenobia in an</p><p>
undertone, and with a malign look which wandered from my face to</p><p>
Priscilla's.  "You know not what you do!  It is dangerous, sir, believe</p><p>
me, to tamper thus with earnest human passions, out of your own mere</p><p>
idleness, and for your sport.  I will endure it no longer!  Take care</p><p>
that it does not happen again!  I warn you!"</p>
<p>
"You partly wrong me, if not wholly," I responded.  "It is an uncertain</p><p>
sense of some duty to perform, that brings my thoughts, and therefore</p><p>
my words, continually to that one point."</p>
<p>
"Oh, this stale excuse of duty!" said Zenobia, in a whisper so full of</p><p>
scorn that it penetrated me like the hiss of a serpent.  "I have often</p><p>
heard it before, from those who sought to interfere with me, and I know</p><p>
precisely what it signifies.  Bigotry; self-conceit; an insolent</p><p>
curiosity; a meddlesome temper; a cold-blooded criticism, founded on a</p><p>
shallow interpretation of half-perceptions; a monstrous scepticism in</p><p>
regard to any conscience or any wisdom, except one's own; a most</p><p>
irreverent propensity to thrust Providence aside, and substitute one's</p><p>
self in its awful place,--out of these, and other motives as miserable</p><p>
as these, comes your idea of duty!  But, beware, sir!  With all your</p><p>
fancied acuteness, you step blindfold into these affairs.  For any</p><p>
mischief that may follow your interference, I hold you responsible!"</p>
<p>
It was evident that, with but a little further provocation, the lioness</p><p>
would turn to bay; if, indeed, such were not her attitude already.  I</p><p>
bowed, and not very well knowing what else to do, was about to</p><p>
withdraw.  But, glancing again towards Priscilla, who had retreated</p><p>
into a corner, there fell upon my heart an intolerable burden of</p><p>
despondency, the purport of which I could not tell, but only felt it to</p><p>
bear reference to her.  I approached and held out my hand; a gesture,</p><p>
however, to which she made no response.  It was always one of her</p><p>
peculiarities that she seemed to shrink from even the most friendly</p><p>
touch, unless it were Zenobia's or Hollingsworth's. Zenobia, all this</p><p>
while, stood watching us, but with a careless expression, as if it</p><p>
mattered very little what might pass.</p>
<p>
"Priscilla," I inquired, lowering my voice, "when do you go back to</p><p>
Blithedale?"</p>
<p>
"Whenever they please to take me," said she.</p>
<p>
"Did you come away of your own free will?"  I asked.</p>
<p>
"I am blown about like a leaf," she replied.  "I never have any free</p><p>
will."</p>
<p>
"Does Hollingsworth know that you are here?" said I.</p>
<p>
"He bade me come," answered Priscilla.</p>
<p>
She looked at me, I thought, with an air of surprise, as if the idea</p><p>
were incomprehensible that she should have taken this step without his</p><p>
agency.</p>
<p>
"What a gripe this man has laid upon her whole being!" muttered I</p><p>
between my teeth.</p>
<p>
"Well, as Zenobia so kindly intimates, I have no more business here. I</p><p>
wash my hands of it all.  On Hollingsworth's head be the consequences!</p><p>
Priscilla," I added aloud, "I know not that ever we may meet again.</p><p>
Farewell!"</p>
<p>
As I spoke the word, a carriage had rumbled along the street, and stopt</p><p>
before the house.  The doorbell rang, and steps were immediately</p><p>
afterwards heard on the staircase.  Zenobia had thrown a shawl over her</p><p>
dress.</p>
<p>
"Mr. Coverdale," said she, with cool courtesy, "you will perhaps excuse</p><p>
us.  We have an engagement, and are going out."</p>
<p>
"Whither?"  I demanded.</p>
<p>
"Is not that a little more than you are entitled to inquire?" said she,</p><p>
with a smile.  "At all events, it does not suit me to tell you."</p>
<p>
The door of the drawing-room opened, and Westervelt appeared.  I</p><p>
observed that he was elaborately dressed, as if for some grand</p><p>
entertainment.  My dislike for this man was infinite.  At that moment</p><p>
it amounted to nothing less than a creeping of the flesh, as when,</p><p>
feeling about in a dark place, one touches something cold and slimy,</p><p>
and questions what the secret hatefulness may be.  And still I could</p><p>
not but acknowledge that, for personal beauty, for polish of manner,</p><p>
for all that externally befits a gentleman, there was hardly another</p><p>
like him.  After bowing to Zenobia, and graciously saluting Priscilla</p><p>
in her corner, he recognized me by a slight but courteous inclination.</p>
<p>
"Come, Priscilla," said Zenobia; "it is time.  Mr. Coverdale,</p><p>
good-evening."</p>
<p>
As Priscilla moved slowly forward, I met her in the middle of the</p><p>
drawing-room.</p>
<p>
"Priscilla," said I, in the hearing of them all, "do you know whither</p><p>
you are going?"</p>
<p>
"I do not know," she answered.</p>
<p>
"Is it wise to go, and is it your choice to go?"  I asked.  "If not, I</p><p>
am your friend, and Hollingsworth's friend.  Tell me so, at once."</p>
<p>
"Possibly," observed Westervelt, smiling, "Priscilla sees in me an</p><p>
older friend than either Mr. Coverdale or Mr. Hollingsworth.  I shall</p><p>
willingly leave the matter at her option."</p>
<p>
While thus speaking, he made a gesture of kindly invitation, and</p><p>
Priscilla passed me, with the gliding movement of a sprite, and took</p><p>
his offered arm.  He offered the other to Zenobia; but she turned her</p><p>
proud and beautiful face upon him with a look which--judging from what</p><p>
I caught of it in profile--would undoubtedly have smitten the man dead,</p><p>
had he possessed any heart, or had this glance attained to it.  It</p><p>
seemed to rebound, however, from his courteous visage, like an arrow</p><p>
from polished steel.  They all three descended the stairs; and when I</p><p>
likewise reached the street door, the carriage was already rolling away.</p>
<p>
XXI. AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE</p>
<p>
Thus excluded from everybody's confidence, and attaining no further, by</p><p>
my most earnest study, than to an uncertain sense of something hidden</p><p>
from me, it would appear reasonable that I should have flung off all</p><p>
these alien perplexities.  Obviously, my best course was to betake</p><p>
myself to new scenes.  Here I was only an intruder.  Elsewhere there</p><p>
might be circumstances in which I could establish a personal interest,</p><p>
and people who would respond, with a portion of their sympathies, for</p><p>
so much as I should bestow of mine.</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, there occurred to me one other thing to be done.</p><p>
Remembering old Moodie, and his relationship with Priscilla, I</p><p>
determined to seek an interview, for the purpose of ascertaining</p><p>
whether the knot of affairs was as inextricable on that side as I found</p><p>
it on all others.  Being tolerably well acquainted with the old man's</p><p>
haunts, I went, the next day, to the saloon of a certain establishment</p><p>
about which he often lurked.  It was a reputable place enough,</p><p>
affording good entertainment in the way of meat, drink, and fumigation;</p><p>
and there, in my young and idle days and nights, when I was neither</p><p>
nice nor wise, I had often amused myself with watching the staid humors</p><p>
and sober jollities of the thirsty souls around me.</p>
<p>
At my first entrance, old Moodie was not there.  The more patiently to</p><p>
await him, I lighted a cigar, and establishing myself in a corner, took</p><p>
a quiet, and, by sympathy, a boozy kind of pleasure in the customary</p><p>
life that was going forward.  The saloon was fitted up with a good deal</p><p>
of taste.  There were pictures on the walls, and among them an</p><p>
oil-painting of a beefsteak, with such an admirable show of juicy</p><p>
tenderness, that the beholder sighed to think it merely visionary, and</p><p>
incapable of ever being put upon a gridiron.  Another work of high art</p><p>
was the lifelike representation of a noble sirloin; another, the</p><p>
hindquarters of a deer, retaining the hoofs and tawny fur; another, the</p><p>
head and shoulders of a salmon; and, still more exquisitely finished, a</p><p>
brace of canvasback ducks, in which the mottled feathers were depicted</p><p>
with the accuracy of a daguerreotype. Some very hungry painter, I</p><p>
suppose, had wrought these subjects of still-life, heightening his</p><p>
imagination with his appetite, and earning, it is to be hoped, the</p><p>
privilege of a daily dinner off whichever of his pictorial viands he</p><p>
liked best.</p>
<p>
Then there was a fine old cheese, in which you could almost discern the</p><p>
mites; and some sardines, on a small plate, very richly done, and</p><p>
looking as if oozy with the oil in which they had been smothered. All</p><p>
these things were so perfectly imitated, that you seemed to have the</p><p>
genuine article before you, and yet with an indescribable, ideal charm;</p><p>
it took away the grossness from what was fleshiest and fattest, and</p><p>
thus helped the life of man, even in its earthliest relations, to</p><p>
appear rich and noble, as well as warm, cheerful, and substantial.</p><p>
There were pictures, too, of gallant revellers, those of the old time,</p><p>
Flemish, apparently, with doublets and slashed sleeves, drinking their</p><p>
wine out of fantastic, long-stemmed glasses; quaffing joyously,</p><p>
quaffing forever, with inaudible laughter and song; while the champagne</p><p>
bubbled immortally against their moustaches, or the purple tide of</p><p>
Burgundy ran inexhaustibly down their throats.</p>
<p>
But, in an obscure corner of the saloon, there was a little Picture</p><p>
excellently done, moreover of a ragged, bloated, New England toper,</p><p>
stretched out on a bench, in the heavy, apoplectic sleep of</p><p>
drunkenness.  The death-in-life was too well portrayed.  You smelt the</p><p>
fumy liquor that had brought on this syncope.  Your only comfort lay in</p><p>
the forced reflection, that, real as he looked, the poor caitiff was</p><p>
but imaginary, a bit of painted canvass, whom no delirium tremens, nor</p><p>
so much as a retributive headache, awaited, on the morrow.</p>
<p>
By this time, it being past eleven o'clock, the two bar-keepers of the</p><p>
saloon were in pretty constant activity.  One of these young men had a</p><p>
rare faculty in the concoction of gin-cocktails.  It was a spectacle to</p><p>
behold, how, with a tumbler in each hand, he tossed the contents from</p><p>
one to the other.  Never conveying it awry, nor spilling the least</p><p>
drop, he compelled the frothy liquor, as it seemed to me, to spout</p><p>
forth from one glass and descend into the other, in a great parabolic</p><p>
curve, as well-defined and calculable as a planet's orbit.  He had a</p><p>
good forehead, with a particularly large development just above the</p><p>
eyebrows; fine intellectual gifts, no doubt, which he had educated to</p><p>
this profitable end; being famous for nothing but gin-cocktails, and</p><p>
commanding a fair salary by his one accomplishment. These cocktails,</p><p>
and other artificial combinations of liquor, (of which there were at</p><p>
least a score, though mostly, I suspect, fantastic in their</p><p>
differences,) were much in favor with the younger class of customers,</p><p>
who, at farthest, had only reached the second stage of potatory life.</p><p>
The staunch, old soakers, on the other hand men who, if put on tap,</p><p>
would have yielded a red alcoholic liquor, by way of blood usually</p><p>
confined themselves to plain brandy-and-water, gin, or West India rum;</p><p>
and, oftentimes, they prefaced their dram with some medicinal remark as</p><p>
to the wholesomeness and stomachic qualities of that particular drink.</p><p>
Two or three appeared to have bottles of their own behind the counter;</p><p>
and, winking one red eye to the bar-keeper, he forthwith produced these</p><p>
choicest and peculiar cordials, which it was a matter of great interest</p><p>
and favor, among their acquaintances, to obtain a sip of.</p>
<p>
Agreeably to the Yankee habit, under whatever circumstances, the</p><p>
deportment of all these good fellows, old or young, was decorous and</p><p>
thoroughly correct.  They grew only the more sober in their cups; there</p><p>
was no confused babble nor boisterous laughter.  They sucked in the</p><p>
joyous fire of the decanters and kept it smouldering in their inmost</p><p>
recesses, with a bliss known only to the heart which it warmed and</p><p>
comforted.  Their eyes twinkled a little, to be sure; they hemmed</p><p>
vigorously after each glass, and laid a hand upon the pit of the</p><p>
stomach, as if the pleasant titillation there was what constituted the</p><p>
tangible part of their enjoyment.  In that spot, unquestionably, and</p><p>
not in the brain, was the acme of the whole affair.  But the true</p><p>
purpose of their drinking--and one that will induce men to drink, or do</p><p>
something equivalent, as long as this weary world shall endure--was the</p><p>
renewed youth and vigor, the brisk, cheerful sense of things present</p><p>
and to come, with which, for about a quarter of an hour, the dram</p><p>
permeated their systems.  And when such quarters of an hour can be</p><p>
obtained in some mode less baneful to the great sum of a man's</p><p>
life,--but, nevertheless, with a little spice of impropriety, to give</p><p>
it a wild flavor,--we temperance people may ring out our bells for</p><p>
victory!</p>
<p>
The prettiest object in the saloon was a tiny fountain, which threw up</p><p>
its feathery jet through the counter, and sparkled down again into an</p><p>
oval basin, or lakelet, containing several goldfishes.  There was a bed</p><p>
of bright sand at the bottom, strewn with coral and rock-work; and the</p><p>
fishes went gleaming about, now turning up the sheen of a golden side,</p><p>
and now vanishing into the shadows of the water, like the fanciful</p><p>
thoughts that coquet with a poet in his dream.  Never before, I</p><p>
imagine, did a company of water-drinkers remain so entirely</p><p>
uncontaminated by the bad example around them; nor could I help</p><p>
wondering that it had not occurred to any freakish inebriate to empty a</p><p>
glass of liquor into their lakelet.  What a delightful idea!  Who would</p><p>
not be a fish, if he could inhale jollity with the essential element of</p><p>
his existence!</p>
<p>
I had begun to despair of meeting old Moodie, when, all at once, I</p><p>
recognized his hand and arm protruding from behind a screen that was</p><p>
set up for the accommodation of bashful topers.  As a matter of course,</p><p>
he had one of Priscilla's little purses, and was quietly insinuating it</p><p>
under the notice of a person who stood near.  This was always old</p><p>
Moodie's way.  You hardly ever saw him advancing towards you, but</p><p>
became aware of his proximity without being able to guess how he had</p><p>
come thither.  He glided about like a spirit, assuming visibility close</p><p>
to your elbow, offering his petty trifles of merchandise, remaining</p><p>
long enough for you to purchase, if so disposed, and then taking</p><p>
himself off, between two breaths, while you happened to be thinking of</p><p>
something else.</p>
<p>
By a sort of sympathetic impulse that often controlled me in those more</p><p>
impressible days of my life, I was induced to approach this old man in</p><p>
a mode as undemonstrative as his own.  Thus, when, according to his</p><p>
custom, he was probably just about to vanish, he found me at his elbow.</p>
<p>
"Ah!" said he, with more emphasis than was usual with him.  "It is Mr.</p><p>
Coverdale!"</p>
<p>
"Yes, Mr. Moodie, your old acquaintance," answered I. "It is some time</p><p>
now since we ate luncheon together at Blithedale, and a good deal</p><p>
longer since our little talk together at the street corner."</p>
<p>
"That was a good while ago," said the old man.</p>
<p>
And he seemed inclined to say not a word more.  His existence looked so</p><p>
colorless and torpid,--so very faintly shadowed on the canvas of</p><p>
reality,--that I was half afraid lest he should altogether disappear,</p><p>
even while my eyes were fixed full upon his figure.  He was certainly</p><p>
the wretchedest old ghost in the world, with his crazy hat, the dingy</p><p>
handkerchief about his throat, his suit of threadbare gray, and</p><p>
especially that patch over his right eye, behind which he always seemed</p><p>
to be hiding himself.  There was one method, however, of bringing him</p><p>
out into somewhat stronger relief.  A glass of brandy would effect it.</p><p>
Perhaps the gentler influence of a bottle of claret might do the same.</p><p>
Nor could I think it a matter for the recording angel to write down</p><p>
against me, if--with my painful consciousness of the frost in this old</p><p>
man's blood, and the positive ice that had congealed about his heart--I</p><p>
should thaw him out, were it only for an hour, with the summer warmth</p><p>
of a little wine.  What else could possibly be done for him?  How else</p><p>
could he be imbued with energy enough to hope for a happier state</p><p>
hereafter?  How else be inspired to say his prayers?  For there are</p><p>
states of our spiritual system when the throb of the soul's life is too</p><p>
faint and weak to render us capable of religious aspiration.</p>
<p>
"Mr. Moodie," said I, "shall we lunch together?  And would you like to</p><p>
drink a glass of wine?"</p>
<p>
His one eye gleamed.  He bowed; and it impressed me that he grew to be</p><p>
more of a man at once, either in anticipation of the wine, or as a</p><p>
grateful response to my good fellowship in offering it.</p>
<p>
"With pleasure," he replied.</p>
<p>
The bar-keeper, at my request, showed us into a private room, and soon</p><p>
afterwards set some fried oysters and a bottle of claret on the table;</p><p>
and I saw the old man glance curiously at the label of the bottle, as</p><p>
if to learn the brand.</p>
<p>
"It should be good wine," I remarked, "if it have any right to its</p><p>
label."</p>
<p>
"You cannot suppose, sir," said Moodie, with a sigh, "that a poor old</p><p>
fellow like me knows any difference in wines."</p>
<p>
And yet, in his way of handling the glass, in his preliminary snuff at</p><p>
the aroma, in his first cautious sip of the wine, and the gustatory</p><p>
skill with which he gave his palate the full advantage of it, it was</p><p>
impossible not to recognize the connoisseur.</p>
<p>
"I fancy, Mr. Moodie," said I, "you are a much better judge of wines</p><p>
than I have yet learned to be.  Tell me fairly,--did you never drink it</p><p>
where the grape grows?"</p>
<p>
"How should that have been, Mr. Coverdale?" answered old Moodie shyly;</p><p>
but then he took courage, as it were, and uttered a feeble little</p><p>
laugh.  "The flavor of this wine," added he, "and its perfume still</p><p>
more than its taste, makes me remember that I was once a young man."</p>
<p>
"I wish, Mr. Moodie," suggested I,--not that I greatly cared about it,</p><p>
however, but was only anxious to draw him into some talk about</p><p>
Priscilla and Zenobia,--"I wish, while we sit over our wine, you would</p><p>
favor me with a few of those youthful reminiscences."</p>
<p>
"Ah," said he, shaking his head, "they might interest you more than you</p><p>
suppose.  But I had better be silent, Mr. Coverdale.  If this good</p><p>
wine,--though claret, I suppose, is not apt to play such a trick,--but</p><p>
if it should make my tongue run too freely, I could never look you in</p><p>
the face again."</p>
<p>
"You never did look me in the face, Mr. Moodie," I replied, "until this</p><p>
very moment."</p>
<p>
"Ah!" sighed old Moodie.</p>
<p>
It was wonderful, however, what an effect the mild grape-juice wrought</p><p>
upon him.  It was not in the wine, but in the associations which it</p><p>
seemed to bring up.  Instead of the mean, slouching, furtive, painfully</p><p>
depressed air of an old city vagabond, more like a gray kennel-rat than</p><p>
any other living thing, he began to take the aspect of a decayed</p><p>
gentleman.  Even his garments--especially after I had myself quaffed a</p><p>
glass or two--looked less shabby than when we first sat down.  There</p><p>
was, by and by, a certain exuberance and elaborateness of gesture and</p><p>
manner, oddly in contrast with all that I had hitherto seen of him.</p><p>
Anon, with hardly any impulse from me, old Moodie began to talk.  His</p><p>
communications referred exclusively to a long-past and more fortunate</p><p>
period of his life, with only a few unavoidable allusions to the</p><p>
circumstances that had reduced him to his present state.  But, having</p><p>
once got the clew, my subsequent researches acquainted me with the main</p><p>
facts of the following narrative; although, in writing it out, my pen</p><p>
has perhaps allowed itself a trifle of romantic and legendary license,</p><p>
worthier of a small poet than of a grave biographer.</p>
<p>
XXII. FAUNTLEROY</p>
<p>
Five-and-twenty years ago, at the epoch of this story, there dwelt in</p><p>
one of the Middle States a man whom we shall call Fauntleroy; a man of</p><p>
wealth, and magnificent tastes, and prodigal expenditure.  His home</p><p>
might almost be styled a palace; his habits, in the ordinary sense,</p><p>
princely.  His whole being seemed to have crystallized itself into an</p><p>
external splendor, wherewith he glittered in the eyes of the world, and</p><p>
had no other life than upon this gaudy surface.  He had married a</p><p>
lovely woman, whose nature was deeper than his own.  But his affection</p><p>
for her, though it showed largely, was superficial, like all his other</p><p>
manifestations and developments; he did not so truly keep this noble</p><p>
creature in his heart, as wear her beauty for the most brilliant</p><p>
ornament of his outward state.  And there was born to him a child, a</p><p>
beautiful daughter, whom he took from the beneficent hand of God with</p><p>
no just sense of her immortal value, but as a man already rich in gems</p><p>
would receive another jewel.  If he loved her, it was because she shone.</p>
<p>
After Fauntleroy had thus spent a few empty years, coruscating</p><p>
continually an unnatural light, the source of it--which was merely his</p><p>
gold--began to grow more shallow, and finally became exhausted. He saw</p><p>
himself in imminent peril of losing all that had heretofore</p><p>
distinguished him; and, conscious of no innate worth to fall back upon,</p><p>
he recoiled from this calamity with the instinct of a soul shrinking</p><p>
from annihilation.  To avoid it,--wretched man!--or rather to defer it,</p><p>
if but for a month, a day, or only to procure himself the life of a few</p><p>
breaths more amid the false glitter which was now less his own than</p><p>
ever,--he made himself guilty of a crime.  It was just the sort of</p><p>
crime, growing out of its artificial state, which society (unless it</p><p>
should change its entire constitution for this man's unworthy sake)</p><p>
neither could nor ought to pardon.  More safely might it pardon murder.</p><p>
Fauntleroy's guilt was discovered.  He fled; his wife perished, by the</p><p>
necessity of her innate nobleness, in its alliance with a being so</p><p>
ignoble; and betwixt her mother's death and her father's ignominy, his</p><p>
daughter was left worse than orphaned.</p>
<p>
There was no pursuit after Fauntleroy.  His family connections, who had</p><p>
great wealth, made such arrangements with those whom he had attempted</p><p>
to wrong as secured him from the retribution that would have overtaken</p><p>
an unfriended criminal.  The wreck of his estate was divided among his</p><p>
creditors: His name, in a very brief space, was forgotten by the</p><p>
multitude who had passed it so diligently from mouth to mouth.  Seldom,</p><p>
indeed, was it recalled, even by his closest former intimates.  Nor</p><p>
could it have been otherwise.  The man had laid no real touch on any</p><p>
mortal's heart.  Being a mere image, an optical delusion, created by</p><p>
the sunshine of prosperity, it was his law to vanish into the shadow of</p><p>
the first intervening cloud.  He seemed to leave no vacancy; a</p><p>
phenomenon which, like many others that attended his brief career, went</p><p>
far to prove the illusiveness of his existence.</p>
<p>
Not, however, that the physical substance of Fauntleroy had literally</p><p>
melted into vapor.  He had fled northward to the New England</p><p>
metropolis, and had taken up his abode, under another name, in a</p><p>
squalid street or court of the older portion of the city.  There he</p><p>
dwelt among poverty-stricken wretches, sinners, and forlorn good</p><p>
people, Irish, and whomsoever else were neediest.  Many families were</p><p>
clustered in each house together, above stairs and below, in the little</p><p>
peaked garrets, and even in the dusky cellars.  The house where</p><p>
Fauntleroy paid weekly rent for a chamber and a closet had been a</p><p>
stately habitation in its day.  An old colonial governor had built it,</p><p>
and lived there, long ago, and held his levees in a great room where</p><p>
now slept twenty Irish bedfellows; and died in Fauntleroy's chamber,</p><p>
which his embroidered and white-wigged ghost still haunted. Tattered</p><p>
hangings, a marble hearth, traversed with many cracks and fissures, a</p><p>
richly carved oaken mantelpiece, partly hacked away for kindling-stuff,</p><p>
a stuccoed ceiling, defaced with great, unsightly patches of the naked</p><p>
laths,--such was the chamber's aspect, as if, with its splinters and</p><p>
rags of dirty splendor, it were a kind of practical gibe at this poor,</p><p>
ruined man of show.</p>
<p>
At first, and at irregular intervals, his relatives allowed Fauntleroy</p><p>
a little pittance to sustain life; not from any love, perhaps, but lest</p><p>
poverty should compel him, by new offences, to add more shame to that</p><p>
with which he had already stained them.  But he showed no tendency to</p><p>
further guilt.  His character appeared to have been radically changed</p><p>
(as, indeed, from its shallowness, it well might) by his miserable</p><p>
fate; or, it may be, the traits now seen in him were portions of the</p><p>
same character, presenting itself in another phase.  Instead of any</p><p>
longer seeking to live in the sight of the world, his impulse was to</p><p>
shrink into the nearest obscurity, and to be unseen of men, were it</p><p>
possible, even while standing before their eyes.  He had no pride; it</p><p>
was all trodden in the dust.  No ostentation; for how could it survive,</p><p>
when there was nothing left of Fauntleroy, save penury and shame!  His</p><p>
very gait demonstrated that he would gladly have faded out of view, and</p><p>
have crept about invisibly, for the sake of sheltering himself from the</p><p>
irksomeness of a human glance.  Hardly, it was averred, within the</p><p>
memory of those who knew him now, had he the hardihood to show his full</p><p>
front to the world.  He skulked in corners, and crept about in a sort</p><p>
of noonday twilight, making himself gray and misty, at all hours, with</p><p>
his morbid intolerance of sunshine.</p>
<p>
In his torpid despair, however, he had done an act which that condition</p><p>
of the spirit seems to prompt almost as often as prosperity and hope.</p><p>
Fauntleroy was again married.  He had taken to wife a forlorn,</p><p>
meek-spirited, feeble young woman, a seamstress, whom he found dwelling</p><p>
with her mother in a contiguous chamber of the old gubernatorial</p><p>
residence.  This poor phantom--as the beautiful and noble companion of</p><p>
his former life had done brought him a daughter. And sometimes, as from</p><p>
one dream into another, Fauntleroy looked forth out of his present</p><p>
grimy environment into that past magnificence, and wondered whether the</p><p>
grandee of yesterday or the pauper of to-day were real.  But, in my</p><p>
mind, the one and the other were alike impalpable.  In truth, it was</p><p>
Fauntleroy's fatality to behold whatever he touched dissolve.  After a</p><p>
few years, his second wife (dim shadow that she had always been) faded</p><p>
finally out of the world, and left Fauntleroy to deal as he might with</p><p>
their pale and nervous child.  And, by this time, among his distant</p><p>
relatives,--with whom he had grown a weary thought, linked with</p><p>
contagious infamy, and which they were only too willing to get rid</p><p>
of,--he was himself supposed to be no more.</p>
<p>
The younger child, like his elder one, might be considered as the true</p><p>
offspring of both parents, and as the reflection of their state. She</p><p>
was a tremulous little creature, shrinking involuntarily from all</p><p>
mankind, but in timidity, and no sour repugnance.  There was a lack of</p><p>
human substance in her; it seemed as if, were she to stand up in a</p><p>
sunbeam, it would pass right through her figure, and trace out the</p><p>
cracked and dusty window-panes upon the naked floor.  But,</p><p>
nevertheless, the poor child had a heart; and from her mother's gentle</p><p>
character she had inherited a profound and still capacity of affection.</p><p>
And so her life was one of love.  She bestowed it partly on her father,</p><p>
but in greater part on an idea.</p>
<p>
For Fauntleroy, as they sat by their cheerless fireside,--which was no</p><p>
fireside, in truth, but only a rusty stove,--had often talked to the</p><p>
little girl about his former wealth, the noble loveliness of his first</p><p>
wife, and the beautiful child whom she had given him.  Instead of the</p><p>
fairy tales which other parents tell, he told Priscilla this. And, out</p><p>
of the loneliness of her sad little existence, Priscilla's love grew,</p><p>
and tended upward, and twined itself perseveringly around this unseen</p><p>
sister; as a grapevine might strive to clamber out of a gloomy hollow</p><p>
among the rocks, and embrace a young tree standing in the sunny warmth</p><p>
above.  It was almost like worship, both in its earnestness and its</p><p>
humility; nor was it the less humble--though the more earnest--because</p><p>
Priscilla could claim human kindred with the being whom she, so</p><p>
devoutly loved.  As with worship, too, it gave her soul the refreshment</p><p>
of a purer atmosphere.  Save for this singular, this melancholy, and</p><p>
yet beautiful affection, the child could hardly have lived; or, had she</p><p>
lived, with a heart shrunken for lack of any sentiment to fill it, she</p><p>
must have yielded to the barren miseries of her position, and have</p><p>
grown to womanhood characterless and worthless. But now, amid all the</p><p>
sombre coarseness of her father's outward life, and of her own,</p><p>
Priscilla had a higher and imaginative life within.  Some faint gleam</p><p>
thereof was often visible upon her face. It was as if, in her spiritual</p><p>
visits to her brilliant sister, a portion of the latter's brightness</p><p>
had permeated our dim Priscilla, and still lingered, shedding a faint</p><p>
illumination through the cheerless chamber, after she came back.</p>
<p>
As the child grew up, so pallid and so slender, and with much</p><p>
unaccountable nervousness, and all the weaknesses of neglected infancy</p><p>
still haunting her, the gross and simple neighbors whispered strange</p><p>
things about Priscilla.  The big, red, Irish matrons, whose innumerable</p><p>
progeny swarmed out of the adjacent doors, used to mock at the pale</p><p>
Western child.  They fancied--or, at least, affirmed it, between jest</p><p>
and earnest--that she was not so solid flesh and blood as other</p><p>
children, but mixed largely with a thinner element.  They called her</p><p>
ghost-child, and said that she could indeed vanish when she pleased,</p><p>
but could never, in her densest moments, make herself quite visible.</p><p>
The sun at midday would shine through her; in the first gray of the</p><p>
twilight, she lost all the distinctness of her outline; and, if you</p><p>
followed the dim thing into a dark corner, behold! she was not there.</p><p>
And it was true that Priscilla had strange ways; strange ways, and</p><p>
stranger words, when she uttered any words at all.  Never stirring out</p><p>
of the old governor's dusky house, she sometimes talked of distant</p><p>
places and splendid rooms, as if she had just left them.  Hidden things</p><p>
were visible to her (at least so the people inferred from obscure hints</p><p>
escaping unawares out of her mouth), and silence was audible.  And in</p><p>
all the world there was nothing so difficult to be endured, by those</p><p>
who had any dark secret to conceal, as the glance of Priscilla's timid</p><p>
and melancholy eyes.</p>
<p>
Her peculiarities were the theme of continual gossip among the other</p><p>
inhabitants of the gubernatorial mansion.  The rumor spread thence into</p><p>
a wider circle.  Those who knew old Moodie, as he was now called, used</p><p>
often to jeer him, at the very street-corners, about his daughter's</p><p>
gift of second-sight and prophecy.  It was a period when science</p><p>
(though mostly through its empirical professors) was bringing forward,</p><p>
anew, a hoard of facts and imperfect theories, that had partially won</p><p>
credence in elder times, but which modern scepticism had swept away as</p><p>
rubbish.  These things were now tossed up again, out of the surging</p><p>
ocean of human thought and experience.  The story of Priscilla's</p><p>
preternatural manifestations, therefore, attracted a kind of notice of</p><p>
which it would have been deemed wholly unworthy a few years earlier.</p><p>
One day a gentleman ascended the creaking staircase, and inquired which</p><p>
was old Moodie's chamber door.  And, several times, he came again.  He</p><p>
was a marvellously handsome man,--still youthful, too, and fashionably</p><p>
dressed.  Except that Priscilla, in those days, had no beauty, and, in</p><p>
the languor of her existence, had not yet blossomed into womanhood,</p><p>
there would have been rich food for scandal in these visits; for the</p><p>
girl was unquestionably their sole object, although her father was</p><p>
supposed always to be present.  But, it must likewise be added, there</p><p>
was something about Priscilla that calumny could not meddle with; and</p><p>
thus far was she privileged, either by the preponderance of what was</p><p>
spiritual, or the thin and watery blood that left her cheek so pallid.</p>
<p>
Yet, if the busy tongues of the neighborhood spared Priscilla in one</p><p>
way, they made themselves amends by renewed and wilder babble on</p><p>
another score.  They averred that the strange gentleman was a wizard,</p><p>
and that he had taken advantage of Priscilla's lack of earthly</p><p>
substance to subject her to himself, as his familiar spirit, through</p><p>
whose medium he gained cognizance of whatever happened, in regions near</p><p>
or remote.  The boundaries of his power were defined by the verge of</p><p>
the pit of Tartarus on the one hand, and the third sphere of the</p><p>
celestial world on the other.  Again, they declared their suspicion</p><p>
that the wizard, with all his show of manly beauty, was really an aged</p><p>
and wizened figure, or else that his semblance of a human body was only</p><p>
a necromantic, or perhaps a mechanical contrivance, in which a demon</p><p>
walked about.  In proof of it, however, they could merely instance a</p><p>
gold band around his upper teeth, which had once been visible to</p><p>
several old women, when he smiled at them from the top of the</p><p>
governor's staircase.  Of course this was all absurdity, or mostly so.</p><p>
But, after every possible deduction, there remained certain very</p><p>
mysterious points about the stranger's character, as well as the</p><p>
connection that he established with Priscilla.  Its nature at that</p><p>
period was even less understood than now, when miracles of this kind</p><p>
have grown so absolutely stale, that I would gladly, if the truth</p><p>
allowed, dismiss the whole matter from my narrative.</p>
<p>
We must now glance backward, in quest of the beautiful daughter of</p><p>
Fauntleroy's prosperity.  What had become of her?  Fauntleroy's only</p><p>
brother, a bachelor, and with no other relative so near, had adopted</p><p>
the forsaken child.  She grew up in affluence, with native graces</p><p>
clustering luxuriantly about her.  In her triumphant progress towards</p><p>
womanhood, she was adorned with every variety of feminine</p><p>
accomplishment.  But she lacked a mother's care.  With no adequate</p><p>
control, on any hand (for a man, however stern, however wise, can never</p><p>
sway and guide a female child), her character was left to shape itself.</p><p>
There was good in it, and evil.  Passionate, self-willed, and</p><p>
imperious, she had a warm and generous nature; showing the richness of</p><p>
the soil, however, chiefly by the weeds that flourished in it, and</p><p>
choked up the herbs of grace.  In her girlhood her uncle died.  As</p><p>
Fauntleroy was supposed to be likewise dead, and no other heir was</p><p>
known to exist, his wealth devolved on her, although, dying suddenly,</p><p>
the uncle left no will.  After his death there were obscure passages in</p><p>
Zenobia's history.  There were whispers of an attachment, and even a</p><p>
secret marriage, with a fascinating and accomplished but unprincipled</p><p>
young man.  The incidents and appearances, however, which led to this</p><p>
surmise soon passed away, and were forgotten.</p>
<p>
Nor was her reputation seriously affected by the report.  In fact, so</p><p>
great was her native power and influence, and such seemed the careless</p><p>
purity of her nature, that whatever Zenobia did was generally</p><p>
acknowledged as right for her to do.  The world never criticised her so</p><p>
harshly as it does most women who transcend its rules.  It almost</p><p>
yielded its assent, when it beheld her stepping out of the common path,</p><p>
and asserting the more extensive privileges of her sex, both</p><p>
theoretically and by her practice.  The sphere of ordinary womanhood</p><p>
was felt to be narrower than her development required.</p>
<p>
A portion of Zenobia's more recent life is told in the foregoing pages.</p><p>
Partly in earnest,--and, I imagine, as was her disposition, half in a</p><p>
proud jest, or in a kind of recklessness that had grown upon her, out</p><p>
of some hidden grief,--she had given her countenance, and promised</p><p>
liberal pecuniary aid, to our experiment of a better social state.  And</p><p>
Priscilla followed her to Blithedale.  The sole bliss of her life had</p><p>
been a dream of this beautiful sister, who had never so much as known</p><p>
of her existence.  By this time, too, the poor girl was enthralled in</p><p>
an intolerable bondage, from which she must either free herself or</p><p>
perish.  She deemed herself safest near Zenobia, into whose large heart</p><p>
she hoped to nestle.</p>
<p>
One evening, months after Priscilla's departure, when Moodie (or shall</p><p>
we call him Fauntleroy?) was sitting alone in the state-chamber of the</p><p>
old governor, there came footsteps up the staircase.  There was a pause</p><p>
on the landing-place.  A lady's musical yet haughty accents were heard</p><p>
making an inquiry from some denizen of the house, who had thrust a head</p><p>
out of a contiguous chamber.  There was then a knock at Moodie's door.</p><p>
"Come in!" said he.</p>
<p>
And Zenobia entered.  The details of the interview that followed being</p><p>
unknown to me,--while, notwithstanding, it would be a pity quite to</p><p>
lose the picturesqueness of the situation,--I shall attempt to sketch</p><p>
it, mainly from fancy, although with some general grounds of surmise in</p><p>
regard to the old man's feelings.</p>
<p>
She gazed wonderingly at the dismal chamber.  Dismal to her, who beheld</p><p>
it only for an instant; and how much more so to him, into whose brain</p><p>
each bare spot on the ceiling, every tatter of the paper-hangings, and</p><p>
all the splintered carvings of the mantelpiece, seen wearily through</p><p>
long years, had worn their several prints! Inexpressibly miserable is</p><p>
this familiarity with objects that have been from the first disgustful.</p>
<p>
"I have received a strange message," said Zenobia, after a moment's</p><p>
silence, "requesting, or rather enjoining it upon me, to come hither.</p><p>
Rather from curiosity than any other motive,--and because, though a</p><p>
woman, I have not all the timidity of one,--I have complied.  Can it be</p><p>
you, sir, who thus summoned me?"</p>
<p>
"It was," answered Moodie.</p>
<p>
"And what was your purpose?" she continued.  "You require charity,</p><p>
perhaps?  In that case, the message might have been more fitly worded.</p><p>
But you are old and poor, and age and poverty should be allowed their</p><p>
privileges.  Tell me, therefore, to what extent you need my aid."</p>
<p>
"Put up your purse," said the supposed mendicant, with an inexplicable</p><p>
smile.  "Keep it,--keep all your wealth,--until I demand it all, or</p><p>
none!  My message had no such end in view.  You are beautiful, they</p><p>
tell me; and I desired to look at you."</p>
<p>
He took the one lamp that showed the discomfort and sordidness of his</p><p>
abode, and approaching Zenobia held it up, so as to gain the more</p><p>
perfect view of her, from top to toe.  So obscure was the chamber, that</p><p>
you could see the reflection of her diamonds thrown upon the dingy</p><p>
wall, and flickering with the rise and fall of Zenobia's breath. It was</p><p>
the splendor of those jewels on her neck, like lamps that burn before</p><p>
some fair temple, and the jewelled flower in her hair, more than the</p><p>
murky, yellow light, that helped him to see her beauty. But he beheld</p><p>
it, and grew proud at heart; his own figure, in spite of his mean</p><p>
habiliments, assumed an air of state and grandeur.</p>
<p>
"It is well," cried old Moodie.  "Keep your wealth.  You are right</p><p>
worthy of it.  Keep it, therefore, but with one condition only."</p>
<p>
Zenobia thought the old man beside himself, and was moved with pity.</p>
<p>
"Have you none to care for you?" asked she.  "No daughter?--no</p><p>
kind-hearted neighbor?--no means of procuring the attendance which you</p><p>
need?  Tell me once again, can I do nothing for you?"</p>
<p>
"Nothing," he replied.  "I have beheld what I wished.  Now leave me.</p><p>
Linger not a moment longer, or I may be tempted to say what would bring</p><p>
a cloud over that queenly brow.  Keep all your wealth, but with only</p><p>
this one condition: Be kind--be no less kind than sisters are--to my</p><p>
poor Priscilla!"</p>
<p>
And, it may be, after Zenobia withdrew, Fauntleroy paced his gloomy</p><p>
chamber, and communed with himself as follows,--or, at all events, it</p><p>
is the only solution which I can offer of the enigma presented in his</p><p>
character:--"I am unchanged,--the same man as of yore!" said he. "True,</p><p>
my brother's wealth--he dying intestate--is legally my own.  I know it;</p><p>
yet of my own choice, I live a beggar, and go meanly clad, and hide</p><p>
myself behind a forgotten ignominy.  Looks this like ostentation?  Ah!</p><p>
but in Zenobia I live again!  Beholding her, so beautiful,--so fit to</p><p>
be adorned with all imaginable splendor of outward state,--the cursed</p><p>
vanity, which, half a lifetime since, dropt off like tatters of once</p><p>
gaudy apparel from my debased and ruined person, is all renewed for her</p><p>
sake.  Were I to reappear, my shame would go with me from darkness into</p><p>
daylight.  Zenobia has the splendor, and not the shame.  Let the world</p><p>
admire her, and be dazzled by her, the brilliant child of my</p><p>
prosperity!  It is Fauntleroy that still shines through her!"  But</p><p>
then, perhaps, another thought occurred to him.</p>
<p>
"My poor Priscilla!  And am I just to her, in surrendering all to this</p><p>
beautiful Zenobia?  Priscilla!  I love her best,--I love her only!--but</p><p>
with shame, not pride.  So dim, so pallid, so shrinking,--the daughter</p><p>
of my long calamity!  Wealth were but a mockery in Priscilla's hands.</p><p>
What is its use, except to fling a golden radiance around those who</p><p>
grasp it?  Yet let Zenobia take heed! Priscilla shall have no wrong!"</p><p>
But, while the man of show thus meditated,--that very evening, so far</p><p>
as I can adjust the dates of these strange incidents,--Priscilla poor,</p><p>
pallid flower!--was either snatched from Zenobia's hand, or flung</p><p>
wilfully away!</p>

Well, I betook myself away, and wandered up and down, like an exorcised</p><p>
spirit that had been driven from its old haunts after a mighty</p><p>
struggle.  It takes down the solitary pride of man, beyond most other</p><p>
things, to find the impracticability of flinging aside affections that</p><p>
have grown irksome.  The bands that were silken once are apt to become</p><p>
iron fetters when we desire to shake them off.  Our souls, after all,</p><p>
are not our own.  We convey a property in them to those with whom we</p><p>
associate; but to what extent can never be known, until we feel the</p><p>
tug, the agony, of our abortive effort to resume an exclusive sway over</p><p>
ourselves.  Thus, in all the weeks of my absence, my thoughts</p><p>
continually reverted back, brooding over the bygone months, and</p><p>
bringing up incidents that seemed hardly to have left a trace of</p><p>
themselves in their passage.  I spent painful hours in recalling these</p><p>
trifles, and rendering them more misty and unsubstantial than at first</p><p>
by the quantity of speculative musing thus kneaded in with them.</p><p>
Hollingsworth, Zenobia, Priscilla!  These three had absorbed my life</p><p>
into themselves.  Together with an inexpressible longing to know their</p><p>
fortunes, there was likewise a morbid resentment of my own pain, and a</p><p>
stubborn reluctance to come again within their sphere.</p>
<p>
All that I learned of them, therefore, was comprised in a few brief and</p><p>
pungent squibs, such as the newspapers were then in the habit of</p><p>
bestowing on our socialist enterprise.  There was one paragraph, which</p><p>
if I rightly guessed its purport bore reference to Zenobia, but was too</p><p>
darkly hinted to convey even thus much of certainty. Hollingsworth,</p><p>
too, with his philanthropic project, afforded the penny-a-liners a</p><p>
theme for some savage and bloody minded jokes; and, considerably to my</p><p>
surprise, they affected me with as much indignation as if we had still</p><p>
been friends.</p>
<p>
Thus passed several weeks; time long enough for my brown and</p><p>
toil-hardened hands to reaccustom themselves to gloves.  Old habits,</p><p>
such as were merely external, returned upon me with wonderful</p><p>
promptitude.  My superficial talk, too, assumed altogether a worldly</p><p>
tone.  Meeting former acquaintances, who showed themselves inclined to</p><p>
ridicule my heroic devotion to the cause of human welfare, I spoke of</p><p>
the recent phase of my life as indeed fair matter for a jest.  But, I</p><p>
also gave them to understand that it was, at most, only an experiment,</p><p>
on which I had staked no valuable amount of hope or fear. It had</p><p>
enabled me to pass the summer in a novel and agreeable way, had</p><p>
afforded me some grotesque specimens of artificial simplicity, and</p><p>
could not, therefore, so far as I was concerned, be reckoned a failure.</p><p>
In no one instance, however, did I voluntarily speak of my three</p><p>
friends.  They dwelt in a profounder region.  The more I consider</p><p>
myself as I then was, the more do I recognize how deeply my connection</p><p>
with those three had affected all my being.</p>
<p>
As it was already the epoch of annihilated space, I might in the time I</p><p>
was away from Blithedale have snatched a glimpse at England, and been</p><p>
back again.  But my wanderings were confined within a very limited</p><p>
sphere.  I hopped and fluttered, like a bird with a string about its</p><p>
leg, gyrating round a small circumference, and keeping up a restless</p><p>
activity to no purpose.  Thus it was still in our familiar</p><p>
Massachusetts--in one of its white country villages--that I must next</p><p>
particularize an incident.</p>
<p>
The scene was one of those lyceum halls, of which almost every village</p><p>
has now its own, dedicated to that sober and pallid, or rather</p><p>
drab-colored, mode of winter-evening entertainment, the lecture.  Of</p><p>
late years this has come strangely into vogue, when the natural</p><p>
tendency of things would seem to be to substitute lettered for oral</p><p>
methods of addressing the public.  But, in halls like this, besides the</p><p>
winter course of lectures, there is a rich and varied series of other</p><p>
exhibitions.  Hither comes the ventriloquist, with all his mysterious</p><p>
tongues; the thaumaturgist, too, with his miraculous transformations of</p><p>
plates, doves, and rings, his pancakes smoking in your hat, and his</p><p>
cellar of choice liquors represented in one small bottle.  Here, also,</p><p>
the itinerant professor instructs separate classes of ladies and</p><p>
gentlemen in physiology, and demonstrates his lessons by the aid of</p><p>
real skeletons, and manikins in wax, from Paris.  Here is to be heard</p><p>
the choir of Ethiopian melodists, and to be seen the diorama of Moscow</p><p>
or Bunker Hill, or the moving panorama of the Chinese wall.  Here is</p><p>
displayed the museum of wax figures, illustrating the wide catholicism</p><p>
of earthly renown, by mixing up heroes and statesmen, the pope and the</p><p>
Mormon prophet, kings, queens, murderers, and beautiful ladies; every</p><p>
sort of person, in short, except authors, of whom I never beheld even</p><p>
the most famous done in wax.  And here, in this many-purposed hall</p><p>
(unless the selectmen of the village chance to have more than their</p><p>
share of the Puritanism, which, however diversified with later</p><p>
patchwork, still gives its prevailing tint to New England</p><p>
character),--here the company of strolling players sets up its little</p><p>
stage, and claims patronage for the legitimate drama.</p>
<p>
But, on the autumnal evening which I speak of, a number of printed</p><p>
handbills--stuck up in the bar-room, and on the sign-post of the hotel,</p><p>
and on the meeting-house porch, and distributed largely through the</p><p>
village--had promised the inhabitants an interview with that celebrated</p><p>
and hitherto inexplicable phenomenon, the Veiled Lady!</p>
<p>
The hall was fitted up with an amphitheatrical descent of seats towards</p><p>
a platform, on which stood a desk, two lights, a stool, and a capacious</p><p>
antique chair.  The audience was of a generally decent and respectable</p><p>
character: old farmers, in their Sunday black coats, with shrewd, hard,</p><p>
sun-dried faces, and a cynical humor, oftener than any other</p><p>
expression, in their eyes; pretty girls, in many-colored attire; pretty</p><p>
young men,--the schoolmaster, the lawyer, or student at law, the</p><p>
shop-keeper,--all looking rather suburban than rural.  In these days,</p><p>
there is absolutely no rusticity, except when the actual labor of the</p><p>
soil leaves its earth-mould on the person.  There was likewise a</p><p>
considerable proportion of young and middle-aged women, many of them</p><p>
stern in feature, with marked foreheads, and a very definite line of</p><p>
eyebrow; a type of womanhood in which a bold intellectual development</p><p>
seems to be keeping pace with the progressive delicacy of the physical</p><p>
constitution.  Of all these people I took note, at first, according to</p><p>
my custom.  But I ceased to do so the moment that my eyes fell on an</p><p>
individual who sat two or three seats below me, immovable, apparently</p><p>
deep in thought, with his back, of course, towards me, and his face</p><p>
turned steadfastly upon the platform.</p>
<p>
After sitting awhile in contemplation of this person's familiar</p><p>
contour, I was irresistibly moved to step over the intervening benches,</p><p>
lay my hand on his shoulder, put my mouth close to his ear, and address</p><p>
him in a sepulchral, melodramatic whisper: "Hollingsworth! where have</p><p>
you left Zenobia?"</p>
<p>
His nerves, however, were proof against my attack.  He turned half</p><p>
around, and looked me in the face with great sad eyes, in which there</p><p>
was neither kindness nor resentment, nor any perceptible surprise.</p>
<p>
"Zenobia, when I last saw her," he answered, "was at Blithedale."</p>
<p>
He said no more.  But there was a great deal of talk going on near me,</p><p>
among a knot of people who might be considered as representing the</p><p>
mysticism, or rather the mystic sensuality, of this singular age. The</p><p>
nature of the exhibition that was about to take place had probably</p><p>
given the turn to their conversation.</p>
<p>
I heard, from a pale man in blue spectacles, some stranger stories than</p><p>
ever were written in a romance; told, too, with a simple, unimaginative</p><p>
steadfastness, which was terribly efficacious in compelling the auditor</p><p>
to receive them into the category of established facts.  He cited</p><p>
instances of the miraculous power of one human being over the will and</p><p>
passions of another; insomuch that settled grief was but a shadow</p><p>
beneath the influence of a man possessing this potency, and the strong</p><p>
love of years melted away like a vapor.  At the bidding of one of these</p><p>
wizards, the maiden, with her lover's kiss still burning on her lips,</p><p>
would turn from him with icy indifference; the newly made widow would</p><p>
dig up her buried heart out of her young husband's grave before the</p><p>
sods had taken root upon it; a mother with her babe's milk in her bosom</p><p>
would thrust away her child.  Human character was but soft wax in his</p><p>
hands; and guilt, or virtue, only the forms into which he should see</p><p>
fit to mould it. The religious sentiment was a flame which he could</p><p>
blow up with his breath, or a spark that he could utterly extinguish.</p><p>
It is unutterable, the horror and disgust with which I listened, and</p><p>
saw that, if these things were to be believed, the individual soul was</p><p>
virtually annihilated, and all that is sweet and pure in our present</p><p>
life debased, and that the idea of man's eternal responsibility was</p><p>
made ridiculous, and immortality rendered at once impossible, and not</p><p>
worth acceptance.  But I would have perished on the spot sooner than</p><p>
believe it.</p>
<p>
The epoch of rapping spirits, and all the wonders that have followed in</p><p>
their train,--such as tables upset by invisible agencies, bells</p><p>
self-tolled at funerals, and ghostly music performed on</p><p>
jew's-harps,--had not yet arrived.  Alas, my countrymen, methinks we</p><p>
have fallen on an evil age!  If these phenomena have not humbug at the</p><p>
bottom, so much the worse for us.  What can they indicate, in a</p><p>
spiritual way, except that the soul of man is descending to a lower</p><p>
point than it has ever before reached while incarnate?  We are pursuing</p><p>
a downward course in the eternal march, and thus bring ourselves into</p><p>
the same range with beings whom death, in requital of their gross and</p><p>
evil lives, has degraded below humanity!  To hold intercourse with</p><p>
spirits of this order, we must stoop and grovel in some element more</p><p>
vile than earthly dust.  These goblins, if they exist at all, are but</p><p>
the shadows of past mortality, outcasts, mere refuse stuff, adjudged</p><p>
unworthy of the eternal world, and, on the most favorable supposition,</p><p>
dwindling gradually into nothingness.  The less we have to say to them</p><p>
the better, lest we share their fate!</p>
<p>
The audience now began to be impatient; they signified their desire for</p><p>
the entertainment to commence by thump of sticks and stamp of</p><p>
boot-heels.  Nor was it a great while longer before, in response to</p><p>
their call, there appeared a bearded personage in Oriental robes,</p><p>
looking like one of the enchanters of the Arabian Nights.  He came upon</p><p>
the platform from a side door, saluted the spectators, not with a</p><p>
salaam, but a bow, took his station at the desk, and first blowing his</p><p>
nose with a white handkerchief, prepared to speak.  The environment of</p><p>
the homely village hall, and the absence of many ingenious contrivances</p><p>
of stage effect with which the exhibition had heretofore been set off,</p><p>
seemed to bring the artifice of this character more openly upon the</p><p>
surface.  No sooner did I behold the bearded enchanter, than, laying my</p><p>
hand again on Hollingsworth's shoulder, I whispered in his ear, "Do you</p><p>
know him?"</p>
<p>
"I never saw the man before," he muttered, without turning his head.</p>
<p>
But I had seen him three times already.</p>
<p>
Once, on occasion of my first visit to the Veiled Lady; a second time,</p><p>
in the wood-path at Blithedale; and lastly, in Zenobia's drawing-room.</p><p>
It was Westervelt.  A quick association of ideas made me shudder from</p><p>
head to foot; and again, like an evil spirit, bringing up reminiscences</p><p>
of a man's sins, I whispered a question in Hollingsworth's ear,--"What</p><p>
have you done with Priscilla?"</p>
<p>
He gave a convulsive start, as if I had thrust a knife into him,</p><p>
writhed himself round on his seat, glared fiercely into my eyes, but</p><p>
answered not a word.</p>
<p>
The Professor began his discourse, explanatory of the psychological</p><p>
phenomena, as he termed them, which it was his purpose to exhibit to</p><p>
the spectators.  There remains no very distinct impression of it on my</p><p>
memory.  It was eloquent, ingenious, plausible, with a delusive show of</p><p>
spirituality, yet really imbued throughout with a cold and dead</p><p>
materialism.  I shivered, as at a current of chill air issuing out of a</p><p>
sepulchral vault, and bringing the smell of corruption along with it.</p><p>
He spoke of a new era that was dawning upon the world; an era that</p><p>
would link soul to soul, and the present life to what we call futurity,</p><p>
with a closeness that should finally convert both worlds into one</p><p>
great, mutually conscious brotherhood.  He described (in a strange,</p><p>
philosophical guise, with terms of art, as if it were a matter of</p><p>
chemical discovery) the agency by which this mighty result was to be</p><p>
effected; nor would it have surprised me, had he pretended to hold up a</p><p>
portion of his universally pervasive fluid, as he affirmed it to be, in</p><p>
a glass phial.</p>
<p>
At the close of his exordium, the Professor beckoned with his</p><p>
hand,--once, twice, thrice,--and a figure came gliding upon the</p><p>
platform, enveloped in a long veil of silvery whiteness.  It fell about</p><p>
her like the texture of a summer cloud, with a kind of vagueness, so</p><p>
that the outline of the form beneath it could not be accurately</p><p>
discerned. But the movement of the Veiled Lady was graceful, free, and</p><p>
unembarrassed, like that of a person accustomed to be the spectacle of</p><p>
thousands; or, possibly, a blindfold prisoner within the sphere with</p><p>
which this dark earthly magician had surrounded her, she was wholly</p><p>
unconscious of being the central object to all those straining eyes.</p>
<p>
Pliant to his gesture (which had even an obsequious courtesy, but at</p><p>
the same time a remarkable decisiveness), the figure placed itself in</p><p>
the great chair.  Sitting there, in such visible obscurity, it was,</p><p>
perhaps, as much like the actual presence of a disembodied spirit as</p><p>
anything that stage trickery could devise.  The hushed breathing of the</p><p>
spectators proved how high-wrought were their anticipations of the</p><p>
wonders to be performed through the medium of this incomprehensible</p><p>
creature.  I, too, was in breathless suspense, but with a far different</p><p>
presentiment of some strange event at hand.</p>
<p>
"You see before you the Veiled Lady," said the bearded Professor,</p><p>
advancing to the verge of the platform.  "By the agency of which I have</p><p>
just spoken, she is at this moment in communion with the spiritual</p><p>
world.  That silvery veil is, in one sense, an enchantment, having been</p><p>
dipped, as it were, and essentially imbued, through the potency of my</p><p>
art, with the fluid medium of spirits.  Slight and ethereal as it</p><p>
seems, the limitations of time and space have no existence within its</p><p>
folds.  This hall--these hundreds of faces, encompassing her within so</p><p>
narrow an amphitheatre--are of thinner substance, in her view, than the</p><p>
airiest vapor that the clouds are made of.  She beholds the Absolute!"</p>
<p>
As preliminary to other and far more wonderful psychological</p><p>
experiments, the exhibitor suggested that some of his auditors should</p><p>
endeavor to make the Veiled Lady sensible of their presence by such</p><p>
methods--provided only no touch were laid upon her person--as they</p><p>
might deem best adapted to that end.  Accordingly, several deep-lunged</p><p>
country fellows, who looked as if they might have blown the apparition</p><p>
away with a breath, ascended the platform.  Mutually encouraging one</p><p>
another, they shouted so close to her ear that the veil stirred like a</p><p>
wreath of vanishing mist; they smote upon the floor with bludgeons;</p><p>
they perpetrated so hideous a clamor, that methought it might have</p><p>
reached, at least, a little way into the eternal sphere.  Finally, with</p><p>
the assent of the Professor, they laid hold of the great chair, and</p><p>
were startled, apparently, to find it soar upward, as if lighter than</p><p>
the air through which it rose.  But the Veiled Lady remained seated and</p><p>
motionless, with a composure that was hardly less than awful, because</p><p>
implying so immeasurable a distance betwixt her and these rude</p><p>
persecutors.</p>
<p>
"These efforts are wholly without avail," observed the Professor, who</p><p>
had been looking on with an aspect of serene indifference.  "The roar</p><p>
of a battery of cannon would be inaudible to the Veiled Lady.  And yet,</p><p>
were I to will it, sitting in this very hall, she could hear the desert</p><p>
wind sweeping over the sands as far off as Arabia; the icebergs</p><p>
grinding one against the other in the polar seas; the rustle of a leaf</p><p>
in an East Indian forest; the lowest whispered breath of the</p><p>
bashfullest maiden in the world, uttering the first confession of her</p><p>
love.  Nor does there exist the moral inducement, apart from my own</p><p>
behest, that could persuade her to lift the silvery veil, or arise out</p><p>
of that chair."</p>
<p>
Greatly to the Professor's discomposure, however, just as he spoke</p><p>
these words, the Veiled Lady arose.  There was a mysterious tremor that</p><p>
shook the magic veil.  The spectators, it may be, imagined that she was</p><p>
about to take flight into that invisible sphere, and to the society of</p><p>
those purely spiritual beings with whom they reckoned her so near akin.</p><p>
Hollingsworth, a moment ago, had mounted the platform, and now stood</p><p>
gazing at the figure, with a sad intentness that brought the whole</p><p>
power of his great, stern, yet tender soul into his glance.</p>
<p>
"Come," said he, waving his hand towards her.  "You are safe!"</p>
<p>
She threw off the veil, and stood before that multitude of people pale,</p><p>
tremulous, shrinking, as if only then had she discovered that a</p><p>
thousand eyes were gazing at her.  Poor maiden!  How strangely had she</p><p>
been betrayed!  Blazoned abroad as a wonder of the world, and</p><p>
performing what were adjudged as miracles,--in the faith of many, a</p><p>
seeress and a prophetess; in the harsher judgment of others, a</p><p>
mountebank,--she had kept, as I religiously believe, her virgin reserve</p><p>
and sanctity of soul throughout it all.  Within that encircling veil,</p><p>
though an evil hand had flung it over her, there was as deep a</p><p>
seclusion as if this forsaken girl had, all the while, been sitting</p><p>
under the shadow of Eliot's pulpit, in the Blithedale woods, at the</p><p>
feet of him who now summoned her to the shelter of his arms. And the</p><p>
true heart-throb of a woman's affection was too powerful for the</p><p>
jugglery that had hitherto environed her.  She uttered a shriek, and</p><p>
fled to Hollingsworth, like one escaping from her deadliest enemy, and</p><p>
was safe forever.</p>
<p>
XXIV. THE MASQUERADERS</p>
<p>
Two nights had passed since the foregoing occurrences, when, in a</p><p>
breezy September forenoon, I set forth from town, on foot, towards</p><p>
Blithedale.  It was the most delightful of all days for a walk, with a</p><p>
dash of invigorating ice-temper in the air, but a coolness that soon</p><p>
gave place to the brisk glow of exercise, while the vigor remained as</p><p>
elastic as before.  The atmosphere had a spirit and sparkle in it.</p><p>
Each breath was like a sip of ethereal wine, tempered, as I said, with</p><p>
a crystal lump of ice.  I had started on this expedition in an</p><p>
exceedingly sombre mood, as well befitted one who found himself tending</p><p>
towards home, but was conscious that nobody would be quite overjoyed to</p><p>
greet him there.  My feet were hardly off the pavement, however, when</p><p>
this morbid sensation began to yield to the lively influences of air</p><p>
and motion.  Nor had I gone far, with fields yet green on either side,</p><p>
before my step became as swift and light as if Hollingsworth were</p><p>
waiting to exchange a friendly hand-grip, and Zenobia's and Priscilla's</p><p>
open arms would welcome the wanderer's reappearance.  It has happened</p><p>
to me on other occasions, as well as this, to prove how a state of</p><p>
physical well-being can create a kind of joy, in spite of the</p><p>
profoundest anxiety of mind.</p>
<p>
The pathway of that walk still runs along, with sunny freshness,</p><p>
through my memory.  I know not why it should be so.  But my mental eye</p><p>
can even now discern the September grass, bordering the pleasant</p><p>
roadside with a brighter verdure than while the summer heats were</p><p>
scorching it; the trees, too, mostly green, although here and there a</p><p>
branch or shrub has donned its vesture of crimson and gold a week or</p><p>
two before its fellows.  I see the tufted barberry-bushes, with their</p><p>
small clusters of scarlet fruit; the toadstools, likewise,--some</p><p>
spotlessly white, others yellow or red,--mysterious growths, springing</p><p>
suddenly from no root or seed, and growing nobody can tell how or</p><p>
wherefore.  In this respect they resembled many of the emotions in my</p><p>
breast.  And I still see the little rivulets, chill, clear, and bright,</p><p>
that murmured beneath the road, through subterranean rocks, and</p><p>
deepened into mossy pools, where tiny fish were darting to and fro, and</p><p>
within which lurked the hermit frog. But no,--I never can account for</p><p>
it, that, with a yearning interest to learn the upshot of all my story,</p><p>
and returning to Blithedale for that sole purpose, I should examine</p><p>
these things so like a peaceful-bosomed naturalist.  Nor why, amid all</p><p>
my sympathies and fears, there shot, at times, a wild exhilaration</p><p>
through my frame.</p>
<p>
Thus I pursued my way along the line of the ancient stone wall that</p><p>
Paul Dudley built, and through white villages, and past orchards of</p><p>
ruddy apples, and fields of ripening maize, and patches of woodland,</p><p>
and all such sweet rural scenery as looks the fairest, a little beyond</p><p>
the suburbs of a town.  Hollingsworth, Zenobia, Priscilla! They glided</p><p>
mistily before me, as I walked.  Sometimes, in my solitude, I laughed</p><p>
with the bitterness of self-scorn, remembering how unreservedly I had</p><p>
given up my heart and soul to interests that were not mine.  What had I</p><p>
ever had to do with them?  And why, being now free, should I take this</p><p>
thraldom on me once again?  It was both sad and dangerous, I whispered</p><p>
to myself, to be in too close affinity with the passions, the errors,</p><p>
and the misfortunes of individuals who stood within a circle of their</p><p>
own, into which, if I stept at all, it must be as an intruder, and at a</p><p>
peril that I could not estimate.</p>
<p>
Drawing nearer to Blithedale, a sickness of the spirits kept</p><p>
alternating with my flights of causeless buoyancy.  I indulged in a</p><p>
hundred odd and extravagant conjectures.  Either there was no such</p><p>
place as Blithedale, nor ever had been, nor any brotherhood of</p><p>
thoughtful laborers, like what I seemed to recollect there, or else it</p><p>
was all changed during my absence.  It had been nothing but dream work</p><p>
and enchantment.  I should seek in vain for the old farmhouse, and for</p><p>
the greensward, the potato-fields, the root-crops, and acres of Indian</p><p>
corn, and for all that configuration of the land which I had imagined.</p><p>
It would be another spot, and an utter strangeness.</p>
<p>
These vagaries were of the spectral throng so apt to steal out of an</p><p>
unquiet heart.  They partly ceased to haunt me, on my arriving at a</p><p>
point whence, through the trees, I began to catch glimpses of the</p><p>
Blithedale farm.  That surely was something real.  There was hardly a</p><p>
square foot of all those acres on which I had not trodden heavily, in</p><p>
one or another kind of toil.  The curse of Adam's posterity--and, curse</p><p>
or blessing be it, it gives substance to the life around us--had first</p><p>
come upon me there.  In the sweat of my brow I had there earned bread</p><p>
and eaten it, and so established my claim to be on earth, and my</p><p>
fellowship with all the sons of labor.  I could have knelt down, and</p><p>
have laid my breast against that soil.  The red clay of which my frame</p><p>
was moulded seemed nearer akin to those crumbling furrows than to any</p><p>
other portion of the world's dust.  There was my home, and there might</p><p>
be my grave.</p>
<p>
I felt an invincible reluctance, nevertheless, at the idea of</p><p>
presenting myself before my old associates, without first ascertaining</p><p>
the state in which they were.  A nameless foreboding weighed upon me.</p><p>
Perhaps, should I know all the circumstances that had occurred, I might</p><p>
find it my wisest course to turn back, unrecognized, unseen, and never</p><p>
look at Blithedale more.  Had it been evening, I would have stolen</p><p>
softly to some lighted window of the old farmhouse, and peeped darkling</p><p>
in, to see all their well-known faces round the supper-board.  Then,</p><p>
were there a vacant seat, I might noiselessly unclose the door, glide</p><p>
in, and take my place among them, without a word.  My entrance might be</p><p>
so quiet, my aspect so familiar, that they would forget how long I had</p><p>
been away, and suffer me to melt into the scene, as a wreath of vapor</p><p>
melts into a larger cloud. I dreaded a boisterous greeting.  Beholding</p><p>
me at table, Zenobia, as a matter of course, would send me a cup of</p><p>
tea, and Hollingsworth fill my plate from the great dish of pandowdy,</p><p>
and Priscilla, in her quiet way, would hand the cream, and others help</p><p>
me to the bread and butter.  Being one of them again, the knowledge of</p><p>
what had happened would come to me without a shock.  For still, at</p><p>
every turn of my shifting fantasies, the thought stared me in the face</p><p>
that some evil thing had befallen us, or was ready to befall.</p>
<p>
Yielding to this ominous impression, I now turned aside into the woods,</p><p>
resolving to spy out the posture of the Community as craftily as the</p><p>
wild Indian before he makes his onset.  I would go wandering about the</p><p>
outskirts of the farm, and, perhaps, catching sight of a solitary</p><p>
acquaintance, would approach him amid the brown shadows of the trees (a</p><p>
kind of medium fit for spirits departed and revisitant, like myself),</p><p>
and entreat him to tell me how all things were.</p>
<p>
The first living creature that I met was a partridge, which sprung up</p><p>
beneath my feet, and whirred away; the next was a squirrel, who</p><p>
chattered angrily at me from an overhanging bough.  I trod along by the</p><p>
dark, sluggish river, and remember pausing on the bank, above one of</p><p>
its blackest and most placid pools (the very spot, with the barkless</p><p>
stump of a tree aslantwise over the water, is depicting itself to my</p><p>
fancy at this instant), and wondering how deep it was, and if any</p><p>
overladen soul had ever flung its weight of mortality in thither, and</p><p>
if it thus escaped the burden, or only made it heavier. And perhaps the</p><p>
skeleton of the drowned wretch still lay beneath the inscrutable depth,</p><p>
clinging to some sunken log at the bottom with the gripe of its old</p><p>
despair.  So slight, however, was the track of these gloomy ideas, that</p><p>
I soon forgot them in the contemplation of a brood of wild ducks, which</p><p>
were floating on the river, and anon took flight, leaving each a bright</p><p>
streak over the black surface.  By and by, I came to my hermitage, in</p><p>
the heart of the white-pine tree, and clambering up into it, sat down</p><p>
to rest.  The grapes, which I had watched throughout the summer, now</p><p>
dangled around me in abundant clusters of the deepest purple,</p><p>
deliciously sweet to the taste, and, though wild, yet free from that</p><p>
ungentle flavor which distinguishes nearly all our native and</p><p>
uncultivated grapes.  Methought a wine might be pressed out of them</p><p>
possessing a passionate zest, and endowed with a new kind of</p><p>
intoxicating quality, attended with such bacchanalian ecstasies as the</p><p>
tamer grapes of Madeira, France, and the Rhine are inadequate to</p><p>
produce.  And I longed to quaff a great goblet of it that moment!</p>
<p>
While devouring the grapes, I looked on all sides out of the peep-holes</p><p>
of my hermitage, and saw the farmhouse, the fields, and almost every</p><p>
part of our domain, but not a single human figure in the landscape.</p><p>
Some of the windows of the house were open, but with no more signs of</p><p>
life than in a dead man's unshut eyes.  The barn-door was ajar, and</p><p>
swinging in the breeze.  The big old dog,--he was a relic of the former</p><p>
dynasty of the farm,--that hardly ever stirred out of the yard, was</p><p>
nowhere to be seen.  What, then, had become of all the fraternity and</p><p>
sisterhood?  Curious to ascertain this point, I let myself down out of</p><p>
the tree, and going to the edge of the wood, was glad to perceive our</p><p>
herd of cows chewing the cud or grazing not far off.  I fancied, by</p><p>
their manner, that two or three of them recognized me (as, indeed, they</p><p>
ought, for I had milked them and been their chamberlain times without</p><p>
number); but, after staring me in the face a little while, they</p><p>
phlegmatically began grazing and chewing their cuds again.  Then I grew</p><p>
foolishly angry at so cold a reception, and flung some rotten fragments</p><p>
of an old stump at these unsentimental cows.</p>
<p>
Skirting farther round the pasture, I heard voices and much laughter</p><p>
proceeding from the interior of the wood.  Voices, male and feminine;</p><p>
laughter, not only of fresh young throats, but the bass of grown</p><p>
people, as if solemn organ-pipes should pour out airs of merriment. Not</p><p>
a voice spoke, but I knew it better than my own; not a laugh, but its</p><p>
cadences were familiar.  The wood, in this portion of it, seemed as</p><p>
full of jollity as if Comus and his crew were holding their revels in</p><p>
one of its usually lonesome glades.  Stealing onward as far as I durst,</p><p>
without hazard of discovery, I saw a concourse of strange figures</p><p>
beneath the overshadowing branches.  They appeared, and vanished, and</p><p>
came again, confusedly with the streaks of sunlight glimmering down</p><p>
upon them.</p>
<p>
Among them was an Indian chief, with blanket, feathers, and war-paint,</p><p>
and uplifted tomahawk; and near him, looking fit to be his woodland</p><p>
bride, the goddess Diana, with the crescent on her head, and attended</p><p>
by our big lazy dog, in lack of any fleeter hound.  Drawing an arrow</p><p>
from her quiver, she let it fly at a venture, and hit the very tree</p><p>
behind which I happened to be lurking.  Another group consisted of a</p><p>
Bavarian broom-girl, a negro of the Jim Crow order, one or two</p><p>
foresters of the Middle Ages, a Kentucky woodsman in his trimmed</p><p>
hunting-shirt and deerskin leggings, and a Shaker elder, quaint,</p><p>
demure, broad-brimmed, and square-skirted.  Shepherds of Arcadia, and</p><p>
allegoric figures from the "Faerie Queen," were oddly mixed up with</p><p>
these.  Arm in arm, or otherwise huddled together in strange</p><p>
discrepancy, stood grim Puritans, gay Cavaliers, and Revolutionary</p><p>
officers with three-cornered cocked hats, and queues longer than their</p><p>
swords.  A bright-complexioned, dark-haired, vivacious little gypsy,</p><p>
with a red shawl over her head, went from one group to another, telling</p><p>
fortunes by palmistry; and Moll Pitcher, the renowned old witch of</p><p>
Lynn, broomstick in hand, showed herself prominently in the midst, as</p><p>
if announcing all these apparitions to be the offspring of her</p><p>
necromantic art.  But Silas Foster, who leaned against a tree near by,</p><p>
in his customary blue frock and smoking a short pipe, did more to</p><p>
disenchant the scene, with his look of shrewd, acrid, Yankee</p><p>
observation, than twenty witches and necromancers could have done in</p><p>
the way of rendering it weird and fantastic.</p>
<p>
A little farther off, some old-fashioned skinkers and drawers, all with</p><p>
portentously red noses, were spreading a banquet on the leaf-strewn</p><p>
earth; while a horned and long-tailed gentleman (in whom I recognized</p><p>
the fiendish musician erst seen by Tam O'Shanter) tuned his fiddle, and</p><p>
summoned the whole motley rout to a dance, before partaking of the</p><p>
festal cheer.  So they joined hands in a circle, whirling round so</p><p>
swiftly, so madly, and so merrily, in time and tune with the Satanic</p><p>
music, that their separate incongruities were blended all together, and</p><p>
they became a kind of entanglement that went nigh to turn one's brain</p><p>
with merely looking at it.  Anon they stopt all of a sudden, and</p><p>
staring at one another's figures, set up a roar of laughter; whereat a</p><p>
shower of the September leaves (which, all day long, had been</p><p>
hesitating whether to fall or no) were shaken off by the movement of</p><p>
the air, and came eddying down upon the revellers.</p>
<p>
Then, for lack of breath, ensued a silence, at the deepest point of</p><p>
which, tickled by the oddity of surprising my grave associates in this</p><p>
masquerading trim, I could not possibly refrain from a burst of</p><p>
laughter on my own separate account.</p>
<p>
"Hush!"  I heard the pretty gypsy fortuneteller say.  "Who is that</p><p>
laughing?"</p>
<p>
"Some profane intruder!" said the goddess Diana.  "I shall send an</p><p>
arrow through his heart, or change him into a stag, as I did Actaeon,</p><p>
if he peeps from behind the trees!"</p>
<p>
"Me take his scalp!" cried the Indian chief, brandishing his tomahawk,</p><p>
and cutting a great caper in the air.</p>
<p>
"I'll root him in the earth with a spell that I have at my tongue's</p><p>
end!" squeaked Moll Pitcher.  "And the green moss shall grow all over</p><p>
him, before he gets free again!"</p>
<p>
"The voice was Miles Coverdale's," said the fiendish fiddler, with a</p><p>
whisk of his tail and a toss of his horns.  "My music has brought him</p><p>
hither.  He is always ready to dance to the Devil's tune!"</p>
<p>
Thus put on the right track, they all recognized the voice at once, and</p><p>
set up a simultaneous shout.</p>
<p>
"Miles!  Miles!  Miles Coverdale, where are you?" they cried. "Zenobia!</p><p>
Queen Zenobia! here is one of your vassals lurking in the wood.</p><p>
Command him to approach and pay his duty!"</p>
<p>
The whole fantastic rabble forthwith streamed off in pursuit of me, so</p><p>
that I was like a mad poet hunted by chimeras.  Having fairly the start</p><p>
of them, however, I succeeded in making my escape, and soon left their</p><p>
merriment and riot at a good distance in the rear.  Its fainter tones</p><p>
assumed a kind of mournfulness, and were finally lost in the hush and</p><p>
solemnity of the wood.  In my haste, I stumbled over a heap of logs and</p><p>
sticks that had been cut for firewood, a great while ago, by some</p><p>
former possessor of the soil, and piled up square, in order to be</p><p>
carted or sledded away to the farmhouse.  But, being forgotten, they</p><p>
had lain there perhaps fifty years, and possibly much longer; until, by</p><p>
the accumulation of moss, and the leaves falling over them, and</p><p>
decaying there, from autumn to autumn, a green mound was formed, in</p><p>
which the softened outline of the woodpile was still perceptible.  In</p><p>
the fitful mood that then swayed my mind, I found something strangely</p><p>
affecting in this simple circumstance.  I imagined the long-dead</p><p>
woodman, and his long-dead wife and children, coming out of their chill</p><p>
graves, and essaying to make a fire with this heap of mossy fuel!</p>
<p>
From this spot I strayed onward, quite lost in reverie, and neither</p><p>
knew nor cared whither I was going, until a low, soft, well-remembered</p><p>
voice spoke, at a little distance.</p>
<p>
"There is Mr. Coverdale!"</p>
<p>
"Miles Coverdale!" said another voice,--and its tones were very stern.</p><p>
"Let him come forward, then!"</p>
<p>
"Yes, Mr. Coverdale," cried a woman's voice,--clear and melodious, but,</p><p>
just then, with something unnatural in its chord,--"you are welcome!</p><p>
But you come half an hour too late, and have missed a scene which you</p><p>
would have enjoyed!"</p>
<p>
I looked up and found myself nigh Eliot's pulpit, at the base of which</p><p>
sat Hollingsworth, with Priscilla at his feet and Zenobia standing</p><p>
before them.</p>
<p>
XXV. THE THREE TOGETHER</p>
<p>
Hollingsworth was in his ordinary working-dress.  Priscilla wore a</p><p>
pretty and simple gown, with a kerchief about her neck, and a calash,</p><p>
which she had flung back from her head, leaving it suspended by the</p><p>
strings.  But Zenobia (whose part among the maskers, as may be</p><p>
supposed, was no inferior one) appeared in a costume of fanciful</p><p>
magnificence, with her jewelled flower as the central ornament of what</p><p>
resembled a leafy crown, or coronet.  She represented the Oriental</p><p>
princess by whose name we were accustomed to know her.  Her attitude</p><p>
was free and noble; yet, if a queen's, it was not that of a queen</p><p>
triumphant, but dethroned, on trial for her life, or, perchance,</p><p>
condemned already.  The spirit of the conflict seemed, nevertheless, to</p><p>
be alive in her.  Her eyes were on fire; her cheeks had each a crimson</p><p>
spot, so exceedingly vivid, and marked with so definite an outline,</p><p>
that I at first doubted whether it were not artificial.  In a very</p><p>
brief space, however, this idea was shamed by the paleness that ensued,</p><p>
as the blood sunk suddenly away.  Zenobia now looked like marble.</p>
<p>
One always feels the fact, in an instant, when he has intruded on those</p><p>
who love, or those who hate, at some acme of their passion that puts</p><p>
them into a sphere of their own, where no other spirit can pretend to</p><p>
stand on equal ground with them.  I was confused,--affected even with a</p><p>
species of terror,--and wished myself away. The intenseness of their</p><p>
feelings gave them the exclusive property of the soil and atmosphere,</p><p>
and left me no right to be or breathe there.</p>
<p>
"Hollingsworth,--Zenobia,--I have just returned to Blithedale," said I,</p><p>
"and had no thought of finding you here.  We shall meet again at the</p><p>
house.  I will retire."</p>
<p>
"This place is free to you," answered Hollingsworth.</p>
<p>
"As free as to ourselves," added Zenobia.  "This long while past, you</p><p>
have been following up your game, groping for human emotions in the</p><p>
dark corners of the heart.  Had you been here a little sooner, you</p><p>
might have seen them dragged into the daylight.  I could even wish to</p><p>
have my trial over again, with you standing by to see fair play!  Do</p><p>
you know, Mr. Coverdale, I have been on trial for my life?"</p>
<p>
She laughed, while speaking thus.  But, in truth, as my eyes wandered</p><p>
from one of the group to another, I saw in Hollingsworth all that an</p><p>
artist could desire for the grim portrait of a Puritan magistrate</p><p>
holding inquest of life and death in a case of witchcraft; in Zenobia,</p><p>
the sorceress herself, not aged, wrinkled, and decrepit, but fair</p><p>
enough to tempt Satan with a force reciprocal to his own; and, in</p><p>
Priscilla, the pale victim, whose soul and body had been wasted by her</p><p>
spells.  Had a pile of fagots been heaped against the rock, this hint</p><p>
of impending doom would have completed the suggestive picture.</p>
<p>
"It was too hard upon me," continued Zenobia, addressing Hollingsworth,</p><p>
"that judge, jury, and accuser should all be comprehended in one man!</p><p>
I demur, as I think the lawyers say, to the jurisdiction.  But let the</p><p>
learned Judge Coverdale seat himself on the top of the rock, and you</p><p>
and me stand at its base, side by side, pleading our cause before him!</p><p>
There might, at least, be two criminals instead of one."</p>
<p>
"You forced this on me," replied Hollingsworth, looking her sternly in</p><p>
the face.  "Did I call you hither from among the masqueraders yonder?</p><p>
Do I assume to be your judge?  No; except so far as I have an</p><p>
unquestionable right of judgment, in order to settle my own line of</p><p>
behavior towards those with whom the events of life bring me in</p><p>
contact.  True, I have already judged you, but not on the world's</p><p>
part,--neither do I pretend to pass a sentence!"</p>
<p>
"Ah, this is very good!" cried Zenobia with a smile.  "What strange</p><p>
beings you men are, Mr. Coverdale!--is it not so?  It is the simplest</p><p>
thing in the world with you to bring a woman before your secret</p><p>
tribunals, and judge and condemn her unheard, and then tell her to go</p><p>
free without a sentence.  The misfortune is, that this same secret</p><p>
tribunal chances to be the only judgment-seat that a true woman stands</p><p>
in awe of, and that any verdict short of acquittal is equivalent to a</p><p>
death sentence!"</p>
<p>
The more I looked at them, and the more I heard, the stronger grew my</p><p>
impression that a crisis had just come and gone.  On Hollingsworth's</p><p>
brow it had left a stamp like that of irrevocable doom, of which his</p><p>
own will was the instrument.  In Zenobia's whole person, beholding her</p><p>
more closely, I saw a riotous agitation; the almost delirious</p><p>
disquietude of a great struggle, at the close of which the vanquished</p><p>
one felt her strength and courage still mighty within her, and longed</p><p>
to renew the contest.  My sensations were as if I had come upon a</p><p>
battlefield before the smoke was as yet cleared away.</p>
<p>
And what subjects had been discussed here?  All, no doubt, that for so</p><p>
many months past had kept my heart and my imagination idly feverish.</p><p>
Zenobia's whole character and history; the true nature of her</p><p>
mysterious connection with Westervelt; her later purposes towards</p><p>
Hollingsworth, and, reciprocally, his in reference to her; and,</p><p>
finally, the degree in which Zenobia had been cognizant of the plot</p><p>
against Priscilla, and what, at last, had been the real object of that</p><p>
scheme.  On these points, as before, I was left to my own conjectures.</p><p>
One thing, only, was certain.  Zenobia and Hollingsworth were friends</p><p>
no longer.  If their heartstrings were ever intertwined, the knot had</p><p>
been adjudged an entanglement, and was now violently broken.</p>
<p>
But Zenobia seemed unable to rest content with the matter in the</p><p>
posture which it had assumed.</p>
<p>
"Ah! do we part so?" exclaimed she, seeing Hollingsworth about to</p><p>
retire.</p>
<p>
"And why not?" said he, with almost rude abruptness.  "What is there</p><p>
further to be said between us?"</p>
<p>
"Well, perhaps nothing," answered Zenobia, looking him in the face, and</p><p>
smiling.  "But we have come many times before to this gray rock, and we</p><p>
have talked very softly among the whisperings of the birch-trees.  They</p><p>
were pleasant hours!  I love to make the latest of them, though not</p><p>
altogether so delightful, loiter away as slowly as may be.  And,</p><p>
besides, you have put many queries to me at this, which you design to</p><p>
be our last interview; and being driven, as I must acknowledge, into a</p><p>
corner, I have responded with reasonable frankness.  But now, with your</p><p>
free consent, I desire the privilege of asking a few questions, in my</p><p>
turn."</p>
<p>
"I have no concealments," said Hollingsworth.</p>
<p>
"We shall see," answered Zenobia.  "I would first inquire whether you</p><p>
have supposed me to be wealthy?"</p>
<p>
"On that point," observed Hollingsworth, "I have had the opinion which</p><p>
the world holds."</p>
<p>
"And I held it likewise," said Zenobia.  "Had I not, Heaven is my</p><p>
witness the knowledge should have been as free to you as me.  It is</p><p>
only three days since I knew the strange fact that threatens to make me</p><p>
poor; and your own acquaintance with it, I suspect, is of at least as</p><p>
old a date.  I fancied myself affluent.  You are aware, too, of the</p><p>
disposition which I purposed making of the larger portion of my</p><p>
imaginary opulence,--nay, were it all, I had not hesitated.  Let me ask</p><p>
you, further, did I ever propose or intimate any terms of compact, on</p><p>
which depended this--as the world would consider it--so important</p><p>
sacrifice?"</p>
<p>
"You certainly spoke of none," said Hollingsworth.</p>
<p>
"Nor meant any," she responded.  "I was willing to realize your dream</p><p>
freely,--generously, as some might think,--but, at all events, fully,</p><p>
and heedless though it should prove the ruin of my fortune. If, in your</p><p>
own thoughts, you have imposed any conditions of this expenditure, it</p><p>
is you that must be held responsible for whatever is sordid and</p><p>
unworthy in them.  And now one other question.  Do you love this girl?"</p>
<p>
"O Zenobia!" exclaimed Priscilla, shrinking back, as if longing for the</p><p>
rock to topple over and hide her.</p>
<p>
"Do you love her?" repeated Zenobia.</p>
<p>
"Had you asked me that question a short time since," replied</p><p>
Hollingsworth, after a pause, during which, it seemed to me, even the</p><p>
birch-trees held their whispering breath, "I should have told</p><p>
you--'No!' My feelings for Priscilla differed little from those of an</p><p>
elder brother, watching tenderly over the gentle sister whom God has</p><p>
given him to protect."</p>
<p>
"And what is your answer now?" persisted Zenobia.</p>
<p>
"I do love her!" said Hollingsworth, uttering the words with a deep</p><p>
inward breath, instead of speaking them outright.  "As well declare it</p><p>
thus as in any other way.  I do love her!"</p>
<p>
"Now, God be judge between us," cried Zenobia, breaking into sudden</p><p>
passion, "which of us two has most mortally offended Him!  At least, I</p><p>
am a woman, with every fault, it may be, that a woman ever had,--weak,</p><p>
vain, unprincipled (like most of my sex; for our virtues, when we have</p><p>
any, are merely impulsive and intuitive), passionate, too, and pursuing</p><p>
my foolish and unattainable ends by indirect and cunning, though</p><p>
absurdly chosen means, as an hereditary bond-slave must; false,</p><p>
moreover, to the whole circle of good, in my reckless truth to the</p><p>
little good I saw before me,--but still a woman!  A creature whom only</p><p>
a little change of earthly fortune, a little kinder smile of Him who</p><p>
sent me hither, and one true heart to encourage and direct me, might</p><p>
have made all that a woman can be! But how is it with you?  Are you a</p><p>
man?  No; but a monster!  A cold, heartless, self-beginning and</p><p>
self-ending piece of mechanism!"</p>
<p>
"With what, then, do you charge me!" asked Hollingsworth, aghast, and</p><p>
greatly disturbed by this attack.  "Show me one selfish end, in all I</p><p>
ever aimed at, and you may cut it out of my bosom with a knife!"</p>
<p>
"It is all self!" answered Zenobia with still intenser bitterness.</p><p>
"Nothing else; nothing but self, self, self!  The fiend, I doubt not,</p><p>
has made his choicest mirth of you these seven years past, and</p><p>
especially in the mad summer which we have spent together.  I see it</p><p>
now!  I am awake, disenchanted, disinthralled!  Self, self, self! You</p><p>
have embodied yourself in a project.  You are a better masquerader than</p><p>
the witches and gypsies yonder; for your disguise is a self-deception.</p><p>
See whither it has brought you!  First, you aimed a death-blow, and a</p><p>
treacherous one, at this scheme of a purer and higher life, which so</p><p>
many noble spirits had wrought out.  Then, because Coverdale could not</p><p>
be quite your slave, you threw him ruthlessly away.  And you took me,</p><p>
too, into your plan, as long as there was hope of my being available,</p><p>
and now fling me aside again, a broken tool!  But, foremost and</p><p>
blackest of your sins, you stifled down your inmost consciousness!--you</p><p>
did a deadly wrong to your own heart!--you were ready to sacrifice this</p><p>
girl, whom, if God ever visibly showed a purpose, He put into your</p><p>
charge, and through whom He was striving to redeem you!"</p>
<p>
"This is a woman's view," said Hollingsworth, growing deadly pale,--"a</p><p>
woman's, whose whole sphere of action is in the heart, and who can</p><p>
conceive of no higher nor wider one!"</p>
<p>
"Be silent!" cried Zenobia imperiously.  "You know neither man nor</p><p>
woman!  The utmost that can be said in your behalf--and because I would</p><p>
not be wholly despicable in my own eyes, but would fain excuse my</p><p>
wasted feelings, nor own it wholly a delusion, therefore I say it--is,</p><p>
that a great and rich heart has been ruined in your breast. Leave me,</p><p>
now.  You have done with me, and I with you.  Farewell!"</p>
<p>
"Priscilla," said Hollingsworth, "come."  Zenobia smiled; possibly I</p><p>
did so too.  Not often, in human life, has a gnawing sense of injury</p><p>
found a sweeter morsel of revenge than was conveyed in the tone with</p><p>
which Hollingsworth spoke those two words.  It was the abased and</p><p>
tremulous tone of a man whose faith in himself was shaken, and who</p><p>
sought, at last, to lean on an affection.  Yes; the strong man bowed</p><p>
himself and rested on this poor Priscilla!  Oh, could she have failed</p><p>
him, what a triumph for the lookers-on!</p>
<p>
And, at first, I half imagined that she was about to fail him.  She</p><p>
rose up, stood shivering like the birch leaves that trembled over her</p><p>
head, and then slowly tottered, rather than walked, towards Zenobia.</p><p>
Arriving at her feet, she sank down there, in the very same attitude</p><p>
which she had assumed on their first meeting, in the kitchen of the old</p><p>
farmhouse.  Zenobia remembered it.</p>
<p>
"Ah, Priscilla!" said she, shaking her head, "how much is changed since</p><p>
then!  You kneel to a dethroned princess.  You, the victorious one!</p><p>
But he is waiting for you.  Say what you wish, and leave me."</p>
<p>
"We are sisters!" gasped Priscilla.</p>
<p>
I fancied that I understood the word and action.  It meant the offering</p><p>
of herself, and all she had, to be at Zenobia's disposal. But the</p><p>
latter would not take it thus.</p>
<p>
"True, we are sisters!" she replied; and, moved by the sweet word, she</p><p>
stooped down and kissed Priscilla; but not lovingly, for a sense of</p><p>
fatal harm received through her seemed to be lurking in Zenobia's</p><p>
heart.  "We had one father!  You knew it from the first; I, but a</p><p>
little while,--else some things that have chanced might have been</p><p>
spared you.  But I never wished you harm.  You stood between me and an</p><p>
end which I desired.  I wanted a clear path.  No matter what I meant.</p><p>
It is over now.  Do you forgive me?"</p>
<p>
"O Zenobia," sobbed Priscilla, "it is I that feel like the guilty one!"</p>
<p>
"No, no, poor little thing!" said Zenobia, with a sort of contempt.</p><p>
"You have been my evil fate, but there never was a babe with less</p><p>
strength or will to do an injury.  Poor child!  Methinks you have but a</p><p>
melancholy lot before you, sitting all alone in that wide, cheerless</p><p>
heart, where, for aught you know,--and as I, alas! believe,--the fire</p><p>
which you have kindled may soon go out.  Ah, the thought makes me</p><p>
shiver for you!  What will you do, Priscilla, when you find no spark</p><p>
among the ashes?"</p>
<p>
"Die!" she answered.</p>
<p>
"That was well said!" responded Zenobia, with an approving smile.</p><p>
"There is all a woman in your little compass, my poor sister.</p><p>
Meanwhile, go with him, and live!"</p>
<p>
She waved her away with a queenly gesture, and turned her own face to</p><p>
the rock.  I watched Priscilla, wondering what judgment she would pass</p><p>
between Zenobia and Hollingsworth; how interpret his behavior, so as to</p><p>
reconcile it with true faith both towards her sister and herself; how</p><p>
compel her love for him to keep any terms whatever with her sisterly</p><p>
affection!  But, in truth, there was no such difficulty as I imagined.</p><p>
Her engrossing love made it all clear.  Hollingsworth could have no</p><p>
fault.  That was the one principle at the centre of the universe.  And</p><p>
the doubtful guilt or possible integrity of other people, appearances,</p><p>
self-evident facts, the testimony of her own senses,--even</p><p>
Hollingsworth's self-accusation, had he volunteered it,--would have</p><p>
weighed not the value of a mote of thistledown on the other side.  So</p><p>
secure was she of his right, that she never thought of comparing it</p><p>
with another's wrong, but left the latter to itself.</p>
<p>
Hollingsworth drew her arm within his, and soon disappeared with her</p><p>
among the trees.  I cannot imagine how Zenobia knew when they were out</p><p>
of sight; she never glanced again towards them.  But, retaining a proud</p><p>
attitude so long as they might have thrown back a retiring look, they</p><p>
were no sooner departed,--utterly departed,--than she began slowly to</p><p>
sink down.  It was as if a great, invisible, irresistible weight were</p><p>
pressing her to the earth.  Settling upon her knees, she leaned her</p><p>
forehead against the rock, and sobbed convulsively; dry sobs they</p><p>
seemed to be, such as have nothing to do with tears.</p>
<p>
XXVI. ZENOBIA AND COVERDALE</p>
<p>
Zenobia had entirely forgotten me.  She fancied herself alone with her</p><p>
great grief.  And had it been only a common pity that I felt for</p><p>
her,--the pity that her proud nature would have repelled, as the one</p><p>
worst wrong which the world yet held in reserve,--the sacredness and</p><p>
awfulness of the crisis might have impelled me to steal away silently,</p><p>
so that not a dry leaf should rustle under my feet.  I would have left</p><p>
her to struggle, in that solitude, with only the eye of God upon her.</p><p>
But, so it happened, I never once dreamed of questioning my right to be</p><p>
there now, as I had questioned it just before, when I came so suddenly</p><p>
upon Hollingsworth and herself, in the passion of their recent debate.</p><p>
It suits me not to explain what was the analogy that I saw or imagined</p><p>
between Zenobia's situation and mine; nor, I believe, will the reader</p><p>
detect this one secret, hidden beneath many a revelation which perhaps</p><p>
concerned me less.  In simple truth, however, as Zenobia leaned her</p><p>
forehead against the rock, shaken with that tearless agony, it seemed</p><p>
to me that the self-same pang, with hardly mitigated torment, leaped</p><p>
thrilling from her heartstrings to my own.  Was it wrong, therefore, if</p><p>
I felt myself consecrated to the priesthood by sympathy like this, and</p><p>
called upon to minister to this woman's affliction, so far as mortal</p><p>
could?</p>
<p>
But, indeed, what could mortal do for her?  Nothing!  The attempt would</p><p>
be a mockery and an anguish.  Time, it is true, would steal away her</p><p>
grief, and bury it and the best of her heart in the same grave.  But</p><p>
Destiny itself, methought, in its kindliest mood, could do no better</p><p>
for Zenobia, in the way of quick relief; than to cause the impending</p><p>
rock to impend a little farther, and fall upon her head. So I leaned</p><p>
against a tree, and listened to her sobs, in unbroken silence.  She was</p><p>
half prostrate, half kneeling, with her forehead still pressed against</p><p>
the rock.  Her sobs were the only sound; she did not groan, nor give</p><p>
any other utterance to her distress.  It was all involuntary.</p>
<p>
At length she sat up, put back her hair, and stared about her with a</p><p>
bewildered aspect, as if not distinctly recollecting the scene through</p><p>
which she had passed, nor cognizant of the situation in which it left</p><p>
her.  Her face and brow were almost purple with the rush of blood.</p><p>
They whitened, however, by and by, and for some time retained this</p><p>
deathlike hue.  She put her hand to her forehead, with a gesture that</p><p>
made me forcibly conscious of an intense and living pain there.</p>
<p>
Her glance, wandering wildly to and fro, passed over me several times,</p><p>
without appearing to inform her of my presence.  But, finally, a look</p><p>
of recognition gleamed from her eyes into mine.</p>
<p>
"Is it you, Miles Coverdale?" said she, smiling.  "Ah, I perceive what</p><p>
you are about!  You are turning this whole affair into a ballad. Pray</p><p>
let me hear as many stanzas as you happen to have ready."</p>
<p>
"Oh, hush, Zenobia!"  I answered.  "Heaven knows what an ache is in my</p><p>
soul!"</p>
<p>
"It is genuine tragedy, is it not?" rejoined Zenobia, with a sharp,</p><p>
light laugh.  "And you are willing to allow, perhaps, that I have had</p><p>
hard measure.  But it is a woman's doom, and I have deserved it like a</p><p>
woman; so let there be no pity, as, on my part, there shall be no</p><p>
complaint.  It is all right, now, or will shortly be so.  But, Mr.</p><p>
Coverdale, by all means write this ballad, and put your soul's ache</p><p>
into it, and turn your sympathy to good account, as other poets do, and</p><p>
as poets must, unless they choose to give us glittering icicles instead</p><p>
of lines of fire.  As for the moral, it shall be distilled into the</p><p>
final stanza, in a drop of bitter honey."</p>
<p>
"What shall it be, Zenobia?"  I inquired, endeavoring to fall in with</p><p>
her mood.</p>
<p>
"Oh, a very old one will serve the purpose," she replied.  "There are</p><p>
no new truths, much as we have prided ourselves on finding some.  A</p><p>
moral?  Why, this: That, in the battlefield of life, the downright</p><p>
stroke, that would fall only on a man's steel headpiece, is sure to</p><p>
light on a woman's heart, over which she wears no breastplate, and</p><p>
whose wisdom it is, therefore, to keep out of the conflict.  Or, this:</p><p>
That the whole universe, her own sex and yours, and Providence, or</p><p>
Destiny, to boot, make common cause against the woman who swerves one</p><p>
hair's-breadth out of the beaten track.  Yes; and add (for I may as</p><p>
well own it, now) that, with that one hair's-breadth, she goes all</p><p>
astray, and never sees the world in its true aspect afterwards."</p>
<p>
"This last is too stern a moral," I observed.  "Cannot we soften it a</p><p>
little?"</p>
<p>
"Do it if you like, at your own peril, not on my responsibility," she</p><p>
answered.  Then, with a sudden change of subject, she went on: "After</p><p>
all, he has flung away what would have served him better than the poor,</p><p>
pale flower he kept.  What can Priscilla do for him?  Put passionate</p><p>
warmth into his heart, when it shall be chilled with frozen hopes?</p><p>
Strengthen his hands, when they are weary with much doing and no</p><p>
performance?  No! but only tend towards him with a blind, instinctive</p><p>
love, and hang her little, puny weakness for a clog upon his arm!  She</p><p>
cannot even give him such sympathy as is worth the name.  For will he</p><p>
never, in many an hour of darkness, need that proud intellectual</p><p>
sympathy which he might have had from me?--the sympathy that would</p><p>
flash light along his course, and guide, as well as cheer him?  Poor</p><p>
Hollingsworth! Where will he find it now?"</p>
<p>
"Hollingsworth has a heart of ice!" said I bitterly.  "He is a wretch!"</p>
<p>
"Do him no wrong," interrupted Zenobia, turning haughtily upon me.</p><p>
"Presume not to estimate a man like Hollingsworth.  It was my fault,</p><p>
all along, and none of his.  I see it now!  He never sought me.  Why</p><p>
should he seek me?  What had I to offer him?  A miserable, bruised, and</p><p>
battered heart, spoilt long before he met me.  A life, too, hopelessly</p><p>
entangled with a villain's!  He did well to cast me off. God be</p><p>
praised, he did it!  And yet, had he trusted me, and borne with me a</p><p>
little longer, I would have saved him all this trouble."</p>
<p>
She was silent for a time, and stood with her eyes fixed on the ground.</p><p>
Again raising them, her look was more mild and calm.</p>
<p>
"Miles Coverdale!" said she.</p>
<p>
"Well, Zenobia," I responded.  "Can I do you any service?"</p>
<p>
"Very little," she replied.  "But it is my purpose, as you may well</p><p>
imagine, to remove from Blithedale; and, most likely, I may not see</p><p>
Hollingsworth again.  A woman in my position, you understand, feels</p><p>
scarcely at her ease among former friends.  New faces,--unaccustomed</p><p>
looks,--those only can she tolerate.  She would pine among familiar</p><p>
scenes; she would be apt to blush, too, under the eyes that knew her</p><p>
secret; her heart might throb uncomfortably; she would mortify herself,</p><p>
I suppose, with foolish notions of having sacrificed the honor of her</p><p>
sex at the foot of proud, contumacious man.  Poor womanhood, with its</p><p>
rights and wrongs!  Here will be new matter for my course of lectures,</p><p>
at the idea of which you smiled, Mr. Coverdale, a month or two ago.</p><p>
But, as you have really a heart and sympathies, as far as they go, and</p><p>
as I shall depart without seeing Hollingsworth, I must entreat you to</p><p>
be a messenger between him and me."</p>
<p>
"Willingly," said I, wondering at the strange way in which her mind</p><p>
seemed to vibrate from the deepest earnest to mere levity.  "What is</p><p>
the message?"</p>
<p>
"True,--what is it?" exclaimed Zenobia.  "After all, I hardly know. On</p><p>
better consideration, I have no message.  Tell him,--tell him something</p><p>
pretty and pathetic, that will come nicely and sweetly into your</p><p>
ballad,--anything you please, so it be tender and submissive enough.</p><p>
Tell him he has murdered me!  Tell him that I'll haunt him! "--She</p><p>
spoke these words with the wildest energy.--"And give him--no, give</p><p>
Priscilla--this!"</p>
<p>
Thus saying, she took the jewelled flower out of her hair; and it</p><p>
struck me as the act of a queen, when worsted in a combat, discrowning</p><p>
herself, as if she found a sort of relief in abasing all her pride.</p>
<p>
"Bid her wear this for Zenobia's sake," she continued.  "She is a</p><p>
pretty little creature, and will make as soft and gentle a wife as the</p><p>
veriest Bluebeard could desire.  Pity that she must fade so soon! These</p><p>
delicate and puny maidens always do.  Ten years hence, let</p><p>
Hollingsworth look at my face and Priscilla's, and then choose betwixt</p><p>
them.  Or, if he pleases, let him do it now."</p>
<p>
How magnificently Zenobia looked as she said this!  The effect of her</p><p>
beauty was even heightened by the over-consciousness and</p><p>
self-recognition of it, into which, I suppose, Hollingsworth's scorn</p><p>
had driven her.  She understood the look of admiration in my face;</p><p>
and--Zenobia to the last--it gave her pleasure.</p>
<p>
"It is an endless pity," said she, "that I had not bethought myself of</p><p>
winning your heart, Mr. Coverdale, instead of Hollingsworth's.  I think</p><p>
I should have succeeded, and many women would have deemed you the</p><p>
worthier conquest of the two.  You are certainly much the handsomest</p><p>
man.  But there is a fate in these things.  And beauty, in a man, has</p><p>
been of little account with me since my earliest girlhood, when, for</p><p>
once, it turned my head.  Now, farewell!"</p>
<p>
"Zenobia, whither are you going?"  I asked.</p>
<p>
"No matter where," said she.  "But I am weary of this place, and sick</p><p>
to death of playing at philanthropy and progress.  Of all varieties of</p><p>
mock-life, we have surely blundered into the very emptiest mockery in</p><p>
our effort to establish the one true system.  I have done with it; and</p><p>
Blithedale must find another woman to superintend the laundry, and you,</p><p>
Mr. Coverdale, another nurse to make your gruel, the next time you fall</p><p>
ill.  It was, indeed, a foolish dream!  Yet it gave us some pleasant</p><p>
summer days, and bright hopes, while they lasted.  It can do no more;</p><p>
nor will it avail us to shed tears over a broken bubble.  Here is my</p><p>
hand!  Adieu!"</p>
<p>
She gave me her hand with the same free, whole-souled gesture as on the</p><p>
first afternoon of our acquaintance, and, being greatly moved, I</p><p>
bethought me of no better method of expressing my deep sympathy than to</p><p>
carry it to my lips.  In so doing, I perceived that this white hand--so</p><p>
hospitably warm when I first touched it, five months since--was now</p><p>
cold as a veritable piece of snow.</p>
<p>
"How very cold!"  I exclaimed, holding it between both my own, with the</p><p>
vain idea of warming it.  "What can be the reason?  It is really</p><p>
deathlike!"</p>
<p>
"The extremities die first, they say," answered Zenobia, laughing. "And</p><p>
so you kiss this poor, despised, rejected hand!  Well, my dear friend,</p><p>
I thank you.  You have reserved your homage for the fallen. Lip of man</p><p>
will never touch my hand again.  I intend to become a Catholic, for the</p><p>
sake of going into a nunnery.  When you next hear of Zenobia, her face</p><p>
will be behind the black veil; so look your last at it now,--for all is</p><p>
over.  Once more, farewell!"</p>
<p>
She withdrew her hand, yet left a lingering pressure, which I felt long</p><p>
afterwards.  So intimately connected as I had been with perhaps the</p><p>
only man in whom she was ever truly interested, Zenobia looked on me as</p><p>
the representative of all the past, and was conscious that, in bidding</p><p>
me adieu, she likewise took final leave of Hollingsworth, and of this</p><p>
whole epoch of her life.  Never did her beauty shine out more</p><p>
lustrously than in the last glimpse that I had of her.  She departed,</p><p>
and was soon hidden among the trees.  But, whether it was the strong</p><p>
impression of the foregoing scene, or whatever else the cause, I was</p><p>
affected with a fantasy that Zenobia had not actually gone, but was</p><p>
still hovering about the spot and haunting it.  I seemed to feel her</p><p>
eyes upon me.  It was as if the vivid coloring of her character had</p><p>
left a brilliant stain upon the air.  By degrees, however, the</p><p>
impression grew less distinct.  I flung myself upon the fallen leaves</p><p>
at the base of Eliot's pulpit.  The sunshine withdrew up the tree</p><p>
trunks and flickered on the topmost boughs; gray twilight made the wood</p><p>
obscure; the stars brightened out; the pendent boughs became wet with</p><p>
chill autumnal dews.  But I was listless, worn out with emotion on my</p><p>
own behalf and sympathy for others, and had no heart to leave my</p><p>
comfortless lair beneath the rock.</p>
<p>
I must have fallen asleep, and had a dream, all the circumstances of</p><p>
which utterly vanished at the moment when they converged to some</p><p>
tragical catastrophe, and thus grew too powerful for the thin sphere of</p><p>
slumber that enveloped them.  Starting from the ground, I found the</p><p>
risen moon shining upon the rugged face of the rock, and myself all in</p><p>
a tremble.</p>
<p>
XXVII. MIDNIGHT</p>
<p>
It could not have been far from midnight when I came beneath</p><p>
Hollingsworth's window, and, finding it open, flung in a tuft of grass</p><p>
with earth at the roots, and heard it fall upon the floor.  He was</p><p>
either awake or sleeping very lightly; for scarcely a moment had gone</p><p>
by before he looked out and discerned me standing in the moonlight.</p>
<p>
"Is it you, Coverdale?" he asked.  "What is the matter?"</p>
<p>
"Come down to me, Hollingsworth!"  I answered.  "I am anxious to speak</p><p>
with you."</p>
<p>
The strange tone of my own voice startled me, and him, probably, no</p><p>
less.  He lost no time, and soon issued from the house-door, with his</p><p>
dress half arranged.</p>
<p>
"Again, what is the matter?" he asked impatiently.</p>
<p>
"Have you seen Zenobia," said I, "since you parted from her at Eliot's</p><p>
pulpit?"</p>
<p>
"No," answered Hollingsworth; "nor did I expect it."</p>
<p>
His voice was deep, but had a tremor in it,</p>
<p>
Hardly had he spoken, when Silas Foster thrust his head, done up in a</p><p>
cotton handkerchief, out of another window, and took what he called as</p><p>
it literally was--a squint at us.</p>
<p>
"Well, folks, what are ye about here?" he demanded.  "Aha! are you</p><p>
there, Miles Coverdale?  You have been turning night into day since you</p><p>
left us, I reckon; and so you find it quite natural to come prowling</p><p>
about the house at this time o' night, frightening my old woman out of</p><p>
her wits, and making her disturb a tired man out of his best nap.  In</p><p>
with you, you vagabond, and to bed!"</p>
<p>
"Dress yourself quickly, Foster," said I. "We want your assistance."</p>
<p>
I could not, for the life of me, keep that strange tone out of my</p><p>
voice.  Silas Foster, obtuse as were his sensibilities, seemed to feel</p><p>
the ghastly earnestness that was conveyed in it as well as</p><p>
Hollingsworth did.  He immediately withdrew his head, and I heard him</p><p>
yawning, muttering to his wife, and again yawning heavily, while he</p><p>
hurried on his clothes.  Meanwhile I showed Hollingsworth a delicate</p><p>
handkerchief, marked with a well-known cipher, and told where I had</p><p>
found it, and other circumstances, which had filled me with a suspicion</p><p>
so terrible that I left him, if he dared, to shape it out for himself.</p><p>
By the time my brief explanation was finished, we were joined by Silas</p><p>
Foster in his blue woollen frock.</p>
<p>
"Well, boys," cried he peevishly, "what is to pay now?"</p>
<p>
"Tell him, Hollingsworth," said I.</p>
<p>
Hollingsworth shivered perceptibly, and drew in a hard breath betwixt</p><p>
his teeth.  He steadied himself, however, and, looking the matter more</p><p>
firmly in the face than I had done, explained to Foster my suspicions,</p><p>
and the grounds of them, with a distinctness from which, in spite of my</p><p>
utmost efforts, my words had swerved aside.  The tough-nerved yeoman,</p><p>
in his comment, put a finish on the business, and brought out the</p><p>
hideous idea in its full terror, as if he were removing the napkin from</p><p>
the face of a corpse.</p>
<p>
"And so you think she's drowned herself?" he cried.  I turned away my</p><p>
face.</p>
<p>
"What on earth should the young woman do that for?" exclaimed Silas,</p><p>
his eyes half out of his head with mere surprise.  "Why, she has more</p><p>
means than she can use or waste, and lacks nothing to make her</p><p>
comfortable, but a husband, and that's an article she could have, any</p><p>
day.  There's some mistake about this, I tell you!"</p>
<p>
"Come," said I, shuddering; "let us go and ascertain the truth."</p>
<p>
"Well, well," answered Silas Foster; "just as you say.  We'll take the</p><p>
long pole, with the hook at the end, that serves to get the bucket out</p><p>
of the draw-well when the rope is broken.  With that, and a couple of</p><p>
long-handled hay-rakes, I'll answer for finding her, if she's anywhere</p><p>
to be found.  Strange enough!  Zenobia drown herself! No, no; I don't</p><p>
believe it.  She had too much sense, and too much means, and enjoyed</p><p>
life a great deal too well."</p>
<p>
When our few preparations were completed, we hastened, by a shorter</p><p>
than the customary route, through fields and pastures, and across a</p><p>
portion of the meadow, to the particular spot on the river-bank which I</p><p>
had paused to contemplate in the course of my afternoon's ramble. A</p><p>
nameless presentiment had again drawn me thither, after leaving Eliot's</p><p>
pulpit.  I showed my companions where I had found the handkerchief, and</p><p>
pointed to two or three footsteps, impressed into the clayey margin,</p><p>
and tending towards the water.  Beneath its shallow verge, among the</p><p>
water-weeds, there were further traces, as yet unobliterated by the</p><p>
sluggish current, which was there almost at a standstill.  Silas Foster</p><p>
thrust his face down close to these footsteps, and picked up a shoe</p><p>
that had escaped my observation, being half imbedded in the mud.</p>
<p>
"There's a kid shoe that never was made on a Yankee last," observed he.</p><p>
"I know enough of shoemaker's craft to tell that.  French manufacture;</p><p>
and see what a high instep! and how evenly she trod in it!  There never</p><p>
was a woman that stept handsomer in her shoes than Zenobia did.  Here,"</p><p>
he added, addressing Hollingsworth, "would you like to keep the shoe?"</p>
<p>
Hollingsworth started back.</p>
<p>
"Give it to me, Foster," said I.</p>
<p>
I dabbled it in the water, to rinse off the mud, and have kept it ever</p><p>
since.  Not far from this spot lay an old, leaky punt, drawn up on the</p><p>
oozy river-side, and generally half full of water.  It served the</p><p>
angler to go in quest of pickerel, or the sportsman to pick up his wild</p><p>
ducks.  Setting this crazy bark afloat, I seated myself in the stern</p><p>
with the paddle, while Hollingsworth sat in the bows with the hooked</p><p>
pole, and Silas Foster amidships with a hay-rake.</p>
<p>
"It puts me in mind of my young days," remarked Silas, "when I used to</p><p>
steal out of bed to go bobbing for hornpouts and eels.</p><p>
Heigh-ho!--well, life and death together make sad work for us all!</p><p>
Then I was a boy, bobbing for fish; and now I am getting to be an old</p><p>
fellow, and here I be, groping for a dead body!  I tell you what, lads;</p><p>
if I thought anything had really happened to Zenobia, I should feel</p><p>
kind o' sorrowful."</p>
<p>
"I wish, at least, you would hold your tongue," muttered I.</p>
<p>
The moon, that night, though past the full, was still large and oval,</p><p>
and having risen between eight and nine o'clock, now shone aslantwise</p><p>
over the river, throwing the high, opposite bank, with its woods, into</p><p>
deep shadow, but lighting up the hither shore pretty effectually. Not a</p><p>
ray appeared to fall on the river itself.  It lapsed imperceptibly</p><p>
away, a broad, black, inscrutable depth, keeping its own secrets from</p><p>
the eye of man, as impenetrably as mid-ocean could.</p>
<p>
"Well, Miles Coverdale," said Foster, "you are the helmsman.  How do</p><p>
you mean to manage this business?"</p>
<p>
"I shall let the boat drift, broadside foremost, past that stump," I</p><p>
replied.  "I know the bottom, having sounded it in fishing.  The shore,</p><p>
on this side, after the first step or two, goes off very abruptly; and</p><p>
there is a pool, just by the stump, twelve or fifteen feet deep.  The</p><p>
current could not have force enough to sweep any sunken object, even if</p><p>
partially buoyant, out of that hollow."</p>
<p>
"Come, then," said Silas; "but I doubt whether I can touch bottom with</p><p>
this hay-rake, if it's as deep as you say.  Mr. Hollingsworth, I think</p><p>
you'll be the lucky man to-night, such luck as it is."</p>
<p>
We floated past the stump.  Silas Foster plied his rake manfully,</p><p>
poking it as far as he could into the water, and immersing the whole</p><p>
length of his arm besides.  Hollingsworth at first sat motionless, with</p><p>
the hooked pole elevated in the air.  But, by and by, with a nervous</p><p>
and jerky movement, he began to plunge it into the blackness that</p><p>
upbore us, setting his teeth, and making precisely such thrusts,</p><p>
methought, as if he were stabbing at a deadly enemy.  I bent over the</p><p>
side of the boat.  So obscure, however, so awfully mysterious, was that</p><p>
dark stream, that--and the thought made me shiver like a leaf--I might</p><p>
as well have tried to look into the enigma of the eternal world, to</p><p>
discover what had become of Zenobia's soul, as into the river's depths,</p><p>
to find her body.  And there, perhaps, she lay, with her face upward,</p><p>
while the shadow of the boat, and my own pale face peering downward,</p><p>
passed slowly betwixt her and the sky!</p>
<p>
Once, twice, thrice, I paddled the boat upstream, and again suffered it</p><p>
to glide, with the river's slow, funereal motion, downward.  Silas</p><p>
Foster had raked up a large mass of stuff, which, as it came towards</p><p>
the surface, looked somewhat like a flowing garment, but proved to be a</p><p>
monstrous tuft of water-weeds.  Hollingsworth, with a gigantic effort,</p><p>
upheaved a sunken log.  When once free of the bottom, it rose partly</p><p>
out of water,--all weedy and slimy, a devilish-looking object, which</p><p>
the moon had not shone upon for half a hundred years,--then plunged</p><p>
again, and sullenly returned to its old resting-place, for the remnant</p><p>
of the century.</p>
<p>
"That looked ugly!" quoth Silas.  "I half thought it was the Evil One,</p><p>
on the same errand as ourselves,--searching for Zenobia."</p>
<p>
"He shall never get her," said I, giving the boat a strong impulse.</p>
<p>
"That's not for you to say, my boy," retorted the yeoman.  "Pray God he</p><p>
never has, and never may.  Slow work this, however!  I should really be</p><p>
glad to find something!  Pshaw!  What a notion that is, when the only</p><p>
good luck would be to paddle, and drift, and poke, and grope,</p><p>
hereabouts, till morning, and have our labor for our pains! For my</p><p>
part, I shouldn't wonder if the creature had only lost her shoe in the</p><p>
mud, and saved her soul alive, after all.  My stars! how she will laugh</p><p>
at us, to-morrow morning!"</p>
<p>
It is indescribable what an image of Zenobia--at the breakfast-table,</p><p>
full of warm and mirthful life--this surmise of Silas Foster's brought</p><p>
before my mind.  The terrible phantasm of her death was thrown by it</p><p>
into the remotest and dimmest background, where it seemed to grow as</p><p>
improbable as a myth.</p>
<p>
"Yes, Silas, it may be as you say," cried I. The drift of the stream</p><p>
had again borne us a little below the stump, when I felt--yes, felt,</p><p>
for it was as if the iron hook had smote my breast--felt</p><p>
Hollingsworth's pole strike some object at the bottom of the river!</p>
<p>
He started up, and almost overset the boat.</p>
<p>
"Hold on!" cried Foster; "you have her!"</p>
<p>
Putting a fury of strength into the effort, Hollingsworth heaved amain,</p><p>
and up came a white swash to the surface of the river.  It was the flow</p><p>
of a woman's garments.  A little higher, and we saw her dark hair</p><p>
streaming down the current.  Black River of Death, thou hadst yielded</p><p>
up thy victim!  Zenobia was found!</p>
<p>
Silas Foster laid hold of the body; Hollingsworth likewise grappled</p><p>
with it; and I steered towards the bank, gazing all the while at</p><p>
Zenobia, whose limbs were swaying in the current close at the boat's</p><p>
side.  Arriving near the shore, we all three stept into the water, bore</p><p>
her out, and laid her on the ground beneath a tree.</p>
<p>
"Poor child!" said Foster,--and his dry old heart, I verily believe,</p><p>
vouchsafed a tear, "I'm sorry for her!"</p>
<p>
Were I to describe the perfect horror of the spectacle, the reader</p><p>
might justly reckon it to me for a sin and shame.  For more than twelve</p><p>
long years I have borne it in my memory, and could now reproduce it as</p><p>
freshly as if it were still before my eyes.  Of all modes of death,</p><p>
methinks it is the ugliest.  Her wet garments swathed limbs of terrible</p><p>
inflexibility.  She was the marble image of a death-agony.  Her arms</p><p>
had grown rigid in the act of struggling, and were bent before her with</p><p>
clenched hands; her knees, too, were bent, and--thank God for it!--in</p><p>
the attitude of prayer.  Ah, that rigidity! It is impossible to bear</p><p>
the terror of it.  It seemed,--I must needs impart so much of my own</p><p>
miserable idea,--it seemed as if her body must keep the same position</p><p>
in the coffin, and that her skeleton would keep it in the grave; and</p><p>
that when Zenobia rose at the day of judgment, it would be in just the</p><p>
same attitude as now!</p>
<p>
One hope I had, and that too was mingled half with fear.  She knelt as</p><p>
if in prayer.  With the last, choking consciousness, her soul, bubbling</p><p>
out through her lips, it may be, had given itself up to the Father,</p><p>
reconciled and penitent.  But her arms!  They were bent before her, as</p><p>
if she struggled against Providence in never-ending hostility.  Her</p><p>
hands!  They were clenched in immitigable defiance. Away with the</p><p>
hideous thought.  The flitting moment after Zenobia sank into the dark</p><p>
pool--when her breath was gone, and her soul at her lips was as long,</p><p>
in its capacity of God's infinite forgiveness, as the lifetime of the</p><p>
world!</p>
<p>
Foster bent over the body, and carefully examined it.</p>
<p>
"You have wounded the poor thing's breast," said he to Hollingsworth,</p><p>
"close by her heart, too!"</p>
<p>
"Ha!" cried Hollingsworth with a start.</p>
<p>
And so he had, indeed, both before and after death!</p>
<p>
"See!" said Foster.  "That's the place where the iron struck her.  It</p><p>
looks cruelly, but she never felt it!"</p>
<p>
He endeavored to arrange the arms of the corpse decently by its side.</p><p>
His utmost strength, however, scarcely sufficed to bring them down; and</p><p>
rising again, the next instant, they bade him defiance, exactly as</p><p>
before.  He made another effort, with the same result.</p>
<p>
"In God's name, Silas Foster," cried I with bitter indignation, "let</p><p>
that dead woman alone!"</p>
<p>
"Why, man, it's not decent!" answered he, staring at me in amazement.</p><p>
"I can't bear to see her looking so!  Well, well," added he, after a</p><p>
third effort, "'tis of no use, sure enough; and we must leave the women</p><p>
to do their best with her, after we get to the house.  The sooner</p><p>
that's done, the better."</p>
<p>
We took two rails from a neighboring fence, and formed a bier by laying</p><p>
across some boards from the bottom of the boat.  And thus we bore</p><p>
Zenobia homeward.  Six hours before, how beautiful!  At midnight, what</p><p>
a horror!  A reflection occurs to me that will show ludicrously, I</p><p>
doubt not, on my page, but must come in for its sterling truth. Being</p><p>
the woman that she was, could Zenobia have foreseen all these ugly</p><p>
circumstances of death,--how ill it would become her, the altogether</p><p>
unseemly aspect which she must put on, and especially old Silas</p><p>
Foster's efforts to improve the matter,--she would no more have</p><p>
committed the dreadful act than have exhibited herself to a public</p><p>
assembly in a badly fitting garment!  Zenobia, I have often thought,</p><p>
was not quite simple in her death.  She had seen pictures, I suppose,</p><p>
of drowned persons in lithe and graceful attitudes.  And she deemed it</p><p>
well and decorous to die as so many village maidens have, wronged in</p><p>
their first love, and seeking peace in the bosom of the old familiar</p><p>
stream,--so familiar that they could not dread it,--where, in</p><p>
childhood, they used to bathe their little feet, wading mid-leg deep,</p><p>
unmindful of wet skirts.  But in Zenobia's case there was some tint of</p><p>
the Arcadian affectation that had been visible enough in all our lives</p><p>
for a few months past.</p>
<p>
This, however, to my conception, takes nothing from the tragedy.  For,</p><p>
has not the world come to an awfully sophisticated pass, when, after a</p><p>
certain degree of acquaintance with it, we cannot even put ourselves to</p><p>
death in whole-hearted simplicity?  Slowly, slowly, with many a dreary</p><p>
pause,--resting the bier often on some rock or balancing it across a</p><p>
mossy log, to take fresh hold,--we bore our burden onward through the</p><p>
moonlight, and at last laid Zenobia on the floor of the old farmhouse.</p><p>
By and by came three or four withered women and stood whispering around</p><p>
the corpse, peering at it through their spectacles, holding up their</p><p>
skinny hands, shaking their night-capped heads, and taking counsel of</p><p>
one another's experience what was to be done.</p>
<p>
With those tire-women we left Zenobia.</p>
<p>
XXVIII. BLITHEDALE PASTURE</p>
<p>
Blithedale, thus far in its progress, had never found the necessity of</p><p>
a burial-ground.  There was some consultation among us in what spot</p><p>
Zenobia might most fitly be laid.  It was my own wish that she should</p><p>
sleep at the base of Eliot's pulpit, and that on the rugged front of</p><p>
the rock the name by which we familiarly knew her, Zenobia,--and not</p><p>
another word, should be deeply cut, and left for the moss and lichens</p><p>
to fill up at their long leisure.  But Hollingsworth (to whose ideas on</p><p>
this point great deference was due) made it his request that her grave</p><p>
might be dug on the gently sloping hillside, in the wide pasture,</p><p>
where, as we once supposed, Zenobia and he had planned to build their</p><p>
cottage.  And thus it was done, accordingly.</p>
<p>
She was buried very much as other people have been for hundreds of</p><p>
years gone by.  In anticipation of a death, we Blithedale colonists had</p><p>
sometimes set our fancies at work to arrange a funereal ceremony, which</p><p>
should be the proper symbolic expression of our spiritual faith and</p><p>
eternal hopes; and this we meant to substitute for those customary</p><p>
rites which were moulded originally out of the Gothic gloom, and by</p><p>
long use, like an old velvet pall, have so much more than their first</p><p>
death-smell in them.  But when the occasion came we found it the</p><p>
simplest and truest thing, after all, to content ourselves with the old</p><p>
fashion, taking away what we could, but interpolating no novelties, and</p><p>
particularly avoiding all frippery of flowers and cheerful emblems.</p><p>
The procession moved from the farmhouse.  Nearest the dead walked an</p><p>
old man in deep mourning, his face mostly concealed in a white</p><p>
handkerchief, and with Priscilla leaning on his arm.  Hollingsworth and</p><p>
myself came next.  We all stood around the narrow niche in the cold</p><p>
earth; all saw the coffin lowered in; all heard the rattle of the</p><p>
crumbly soil upon its lid,--that final sound, which mortality awakens</p><p>
on the utmost verge of sense, as if in the vain hope of bringing an</p><p>
echo from the spiritual world.</p>
<p>
I noticed a stranger,--a stranger to most of those present, though</p><p>
known to me,--who, after the coffin had descended, took up a handful of</p><p>
earth and flung it first into the grave.  I had given up</p><p>
Hollingsworth's arm, and now found myself near this man.</p>
<p>
"It was an idle thing--a foolish thing--for Zenobia to do," said he.</p><p>
"She was the last woman in the world to whom death could have been</p><p>
necessary.  It was too absurd!  I have no patience with her."</p>
<p>
"Why so?"  I inquired, smothering my horror at his cold comment, in my</p><p>
eager curiosity to discover some tangible truth as to his relation with</p><p>
Zenobia.  "If any crisis could justify the sad wrong she offered to</p><p>
herself, it was surely that in which she stood.  Everything had failed</p><p>
her; prosperity in the world's sense, for her opulence was gone,--the</p><p>
heart's prosperity, in love.  And there was a secret burden on her, the</p><p>
nature of which is best known to you.  Young as she was, she had tried</p><p>
life fully, had no more to hope, and something, perhaps, to fear.  Had</p><p>
Providence taken her away in its own holy hand, I should have thought</p><p>
it the kindest dispensation that could be awarded to one so wrecked."</p>
<p>
"You mistake the matter completely," rejoined Westervelt.</p>
<p>
"What, then, is your own view of it?"  I asked.</p>
<p>
"Her mind was active, and various in its powers," said he.  "Her heart</p><p>
had a manifold adaptation; her constitution an infinite buoyancy, which</p><p>
(had she possessed only a little patience to await the reflux of her</p><p>
troubles) would have borne her upward triumphantly for twenty years to</p><p>
come.  Her beauty would not have waned--or scarcely so, and surely not</p><p>
beyond the reach of art to restore it--in all that time.  She had</p><p>
life's summer all before her, and a hundred varieties of brilliant</p><p>
success.  What an actress Zenobia might have been!  It was one of her</p><p>
least valuable capabilities.  How forcibly she might have wrought upon</p><p>
the world, either directly in her own person, or by her influence upon</p><p>
some man, or a series of men, of controlling genius!  Every prize that</p><p>
could be worth a woman's having--and many prizes which other women are</p><p>
too timid to desire--lay within Zenobia's reach."</p>
<p>
"In all this," I observed, "there would have been nothing to satisfy</p><p>
her heart."</p>
<p>
"Her heart!" answered Westervelt contemptuously.  "That troublesome</p><p>
organ (as she had hitherto found it) would have been kept in its due</p><p>
place and degree, and have had all the gratification it could fairly</p><p>
claim.  She would soon have established a control over it.  Love had</p><p>
failed her, you say.  Had it never failed her before?  Yet she survived</p><p>
it, and loved again,--possibly not once alone, nor twice either.  And</p><p>
now to drown herself for yonder dreamy philanthropist!"</p>
<p>
"Who are you," I exclaimed indignantly, "that dare to speak thus of the</p><p>
dead?  You seem to intend a eulogy, yet leave out whatever was noblest</p><p>
in her, and blacken while you mean to praise.  I have long considered</p><p>
you as Zenobia's evil fate.  Your sentiments confirm me in the idea,</p><p>
but leave me still ignorant as to the mode in which you have influenced</p><p>
her life.  The connection may have been indissoluble, except by death.</p><p>
Then, indeed,--always in the hope of God's infinite mercy,--I cannot</p><p>
deem it a misfortune that she sleeps in yonder grave!"</p>
<p>
"No matter what I was to her," he answered gloomily, yet without actual</p><p>
emotion.  "She is now beyond my reach.  Had she lived, and hearkened to</p><p>
my counsels, we might have served each other well.  But there Zenobia</p><p>
lies in yonder pit, with the dull earth over her. Twenty years of a</p><p>
brilliant lifetime thrown away for a mere woman's whim!"</p>
<p>
Heaven deal with Westervelt according to his nature and deserts!--that</p><p>
is to say, annihilate him.  He was altogether earthy, worldly, made for</p><p>
time and its gross objects, and incapable--except by a sort of dim</p><p>
reflection caught from other minds--of so much as one spiritual idea.</p><p>
Whatever stain Zenobia had was caught from him; nor does it seldom</p><p>
happen that a character of admirable qualities loses its better life</p><p>
because the atmosphere that should sustain it is rendered poisonous by</p><p>
such breath as this man mingled with Zenobia's. Yet his reflections</p><p>
possessed their share of truth.  It was a woeful thought, that a woman</p><p>
of Zenobia's diversified capacity should have fancied herself</p><p>
irretrievably defeated on the broad battlefield of life, and with no</p><p>
refuge, save to fall on her own sword, merely because Love had gone</p><p>
against her.  It is nonsense, and a miserable wrong,--the result, like</p><p>
so many others, of masculine egotism,--that the success or failure of</p><p>
woman's existence should be made to depend wholly on the affections,</p><p>
and on one species of affection, while man has such a multitude of</p><p>
other chances, that this seems but an incident.  For its own sake, if</p><p>
it will do no more, the world should throw open all its avenues to the</p><p>
passport of a woman's bleeding heart.</p>
<p>
As we stood around the grave, I looked often towards Priscilla,</p><p>
dreading to see her wholly overcome with grief.  And deeply grieved, in</p><p>
truth, she was.  But a character so simply constituted as hers has room</p><p>
only for a single predominant affection.  No other feeling can touch</p><p>
the heart's inmost core, nor do it any deadly mischief.  Thus, while we</p><p>
see that such a being responds to every breeze with tremulous</p><p>
vibration, and imagine that she must be shattered by the first rude</p><p>
blast, we find her retaining her equilibrium amid shocks that might</p><p>
have overthrown many a sturdier frame.  So with Priscilla; her one</p><p>
possible misfortune was Hollingsworth's unkindness; and that was</p><p>
destined never to befall her, never yet, at least, for Priscilla has</p><p>
not died.</p>
<p>
But Hollingsworth!  After all the evil that he did, are we to leave him</p><p>
thus, blest with the entire devotion of this one true heart, and with</p><p>
wealth at his disposal to execute the long-contemplated project that</p><p>
had led him so far astray?  What retribution is there here?  My mind</p><p>
being vexed with precisely this query, I made a journey, some years</p><p>
since, for the sole purpose of catching a last glimpse of</p><p>
Hollingsworth, and judging for myself whether he were a happy man or</p><p>
no.  I learned that he inhabited a small cottage, that his way of life</p><p>
was exceedingly retired, and that my only chance of encountering him or</p><p>
Priscilla was to meet them in a secluded lane, where, in the latter</p><p>
part of the afternoon, they were accustomed to walk.  I did meet them,</p><p>
accordingly.  As they approached me, I observed in Hollingsworth's face</p><p>
a depressed and melancholy look, that seemed habitual; the powerfully</p><p>
built man showed a self-distrustful weakness, and a childlike or</p><p>
childish tendency to press close, and closer still, to the side of the</p><p>
slender woman whose arm was within his.  In Priscilla's manner there</p><p>
was a protective and watchful quality, as if she felt herself the</p><p>
guardian of her companion; but, likewise, a deep, submissive,</p><p>
unquestioning reverence, and also a veiled happiness in her fair and</p><p>
quiet countenance.</p>
<p>
Drawing nearer, Priscilla recognized me, and gave me a kind and</p><p>
friendly smile, but with a slight gesture, which I could not help</p><p>
interpreting as an entreaty not to make myself known to Hollingsworth.</p><p>
Nevertheless, an impulse took possession of me, and compelled me to</p><p>
address him.</p>
<p>
"I have come, Hollingsworth," said I, "to view your grand edifice for</p><p>
the reformation of criminals.  Is it finished yet?"</p>
<p>
"No, nor begun," answered he, without raising his eyes.  "A very small</p><p>
one answers all my purposes."</p>
<p>
Priscilla threw me an upbraiding glance.  But I spoke again, with a</p><p>
bitter and revengeful emotion, as if flinging a poisoned arrow at</p><p>
Hollingsworth's heart.</p>
<p>
"Up to this moment," I inquired, "how many criminals have you reformed?"</p>
<p>
"Not one," said Hollingsworth, with his eyes still fixed on the ground.</p><p>
"Ever since we parted, I have been busy with a single murderer."</p>
<p>
Then the tears gushed into my eyes, and I forgave him; for I remembered</p><p>
the wild energy, the passionate shriek, with which Zenobia had spoken</p><p>
those words, "Tell him he has murdered me!  Tell him that I'll haunt</p><p>
him!"--and I knew what murderer he meant, and whose vindictive shadow</p><p>
dogged the side where Priscilla was not.</p>
<p>
The moral which presents itself to my reflections, as drawn from</p><p>
Hollingsworth's character and errors, is simply this, that, admitting</p><p>
what is called philanthropy, when adopted as a profession, to be often</p><p>
useful by its energetic impulse to society at large, it is perilous to</p><p>
the individual whose ruling passion, in one exclusive channel, it thus</p><p>
becomes.  It ruins, or is fearfully apt to ruin, the heart, the rich</p><p>
juices of which God never meant should be pressed violently out and</p><p>
distilled into alcoholic liquor by an unnatural process, but should</p><p>
render life sweet, bland, and gently beneficent, and insensibly</p><p>
influence other hearts and other lives to the same blessed end.  I see</p><p>
in Hollingsworth an exemplification of the most awful truth in Bunyan's</p><p>
book of such, from the very gate of heaven there is a by-way to the pit!</p>
<p>
But, all this while, we have been standing by Zenobia's grave.  I have</p><p>
never since beheld it, but make no question that the grass grew all the</p><p>
better, on that little parallelogram of pasture land, for the decay of</p><p>
the beautiful woman who slept beneath.  How Nature seems to love us!</p><p>
And how readily, nevertheless, without a sigh or a complaint, she</p><p>
converts us to a meaner purpose, when her highest one--that of a</p><p>
conscious intellectual life and sensibility has been untimely balked!</p><p>
While Zenobia lived, Nature was proud of her, and directed all eyes</p><p>
upon that radiant presence, as her fairest handiwork.  Zenobia</p><p>
perished.  Will not Nature shed a tear?  Ah, no!--she adopts the</p><p>
calamity at once into her system, and is just as well pleased, for</p><p>
aught we can see, with the tuft of ranker vegetation that grew out of</p><p>
Zenobia's heart, as with all the beauty which has bequeathed us no</p><p>
earthly representative except in this crop of weeds.  It is because the</p><p>
spirit is inestimable that the lifeless body is so little valued.</p>
<p>
XXIX. MILES COVERDALE'S CONFESSION</p>
<p>
It remains only to say a few words about myself.  Not improbably, the</p><p>
reader might be willing to spare me the trouble; for I have made but a</p><p>
poor and dim figure in my own narrative, establishing no separate</p><p>
interest, and suffering my colorless life to take its hue from other</p><p>
lives.  But one still retains some little consideration for one's self;</p><p>
so I keep these last two or three pages for my individual and sole</p><p>
behoof.</p>
<p>
But what, after all, have I to tell?  Nothing, nothing, nothing!  I</p><p>
left Blithedale within the week after Zenobia's death, and went back</p><p>
thither no more.  The whole soil of our farm, for a long time</p><p>
afterwards, seemed but the sodded earth over her grave.  I could not</p><p>
toil there, nor live upon its products.  Often, however, in these years</p><p>
that are darkening around me, I remember our beautiful scheme of a</p><p>
noble and unselfish life; and how fair, in that first summer, appeared</p><p>
the prospect that it might endure for generations, and be perfected, as</p><p>
the ages rolled away, into the system of a people and a world!  Were my</p><p>
former associates now there,--were there only three or four of those</p><p>
true-hearted men still laboring in the sun,--I sometimes fancy that I</p><p>
should direct my world-weary footsteps thitherward, and entreat them to</p><p>
receive me, for old friendship's sake.  More and more I feel that we</p><p>
had struck upon what ought to be a truth.  Posterity may dig it up, and</p><p>
profit by it.  The experiment, so far as its original projectors were</p><p>
concerned, proved, long ago, a failure; first lapsing into Fourierism,</p><p>
and dying, as it well deserved, for this infidelity to its own higher</p><p>
spirit.  Where once we toiled with our whole hopeful hearts, the town</p><p>
paupers, aged, nerveless, and disconsolate, creep sluggishly afield.</p><p>
Alas, what faith is requisite to bear up against such results of</p><p>
generous effort!</p>
<p>
My subsequent life has passed,--I was going to say happily, but, at all</p><p>
events, tolerably enough.  I am now at middle age, well, well, a step</p><p>
or two beyond the midmost point, and I care not a fig who knows it!--a</p><p>
bachelor, with no very decided purpose of ever being otherwise. I have</p><p>
been twice to Europe, and spent a year or two rather agreeably at each</p><p>
visit.  Being well to do in the world, and having nobody but myself to</p><p>
care for, I live very much at my ease, and fare sumptuously every day.</p><p>
As for poetry, I have given it up, notwithstanding that Dr.</p><p>
Griswold--as the reader, of course, knows--has placed me at a fair</p><p>
elevation among our minor minstrelsy, on the strength of my pretty</p><p>
little volume, published ten years ago. As regards human progress (in</p><p>
spite of my irrepressible yearnings over the Blithedale reminiscences),</p><p>
let them believe in it who can, and aid in it who choose.  If I could</p><p>
earnestly do either, it might be all the better for my comfort.  As</p><p>
Hollingsworth once told me, I lack a purpose.  How strange!  He was</p><p>
ruined, morally, by an overplus of the very same ingredient, the want</p><p>
of which, I occasionally suspect, has rendered my own life all an</p><p>
emptiness.  I by no means wish to die.  Yet, were there any cause, in</p><p>
this whole chaos of human struggle, worth a sane man's dying for, and</p><p>
which my death would benefit, then--provided, however, the effort did</p><p>
not involve an unreasonable amount of trouble--methinks I might be bold</p><p>
to offer up my life.  If Kossuth, for example, would pitch the</p><p>
battlefield of Hungarian rights within an easy ride of my abode, and</p><p>
choose a mild, sunny morning, after breakfast, for the conflict, Miles</p><p>
Coverdale would gladly be his man, for one brave rush upon the levelled</p><p>
bayonets.  Further than that, I should be loath to pledge myself.</p>
<p>
I exaggerate my own defects.  The reader must not take my own word for</p><p>
it, nor believe me altogether changed from the young man who once hoped</p><p>
strenuously, and struggled not so much amiss.  Frostier heads than mine</p><p>
have gained honor in the world; frostier hearts have imbibed new</p><p>
warmth, and been newly happy.  Life, however, it must be owned, has</p><p>
come to rather an idle pass with me.  Would my friends like to know</p><p>
what brought it thither?  There is one secret,--I have concealed it all</p><p>
along, and never meant to let the least whisper of it escape,--one</p><p>
foolish little secret, which possibly may have had something to do with</p><p>
these inactive years of meridian manhood, with my bachelorship, with</p><p>
the unsatisfied retrospect that I fling back on life, and my listless</p><p>
glance towards the future.  Shall I reveal it? It is an absurd thing</p><p>
for a man in his afternoon,--a man of the world, moreover, with these</p><p>
three white hairs in his brown mustache and that deepening track of a</p><p>
crow's-foot on each temple,--an absurd thing ever to have happened, and</p><p>
quite the absurdest for an old bachelor, like me, to talk about.  But</p><p>
it rises to my throat; so let it come.</p>
<p>
I perceive, moreover, that the confession, brief as it shall be, will</p><p>
throw a gleam of light over my behavior throughout the foregoing</p><p>
incidents, and is, indeed, essential to the full understanding of my</p><p>
story.  The reader, therefore, since I have disclosed so much, is</p><p>
entitled to this one word more.  As I write it, he will charitably</p><p>
suppose me to blush, and turn away my face:</p>
<p>
I--I myself--was in love--with--Priscilla!</p>
